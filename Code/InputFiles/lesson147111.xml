        <title>Main page - choose lesson part</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You don't have to finish the lesson all in one sitting.  You can also retry it if you are not satisfied with how you did.  Here is a "map" of the lesson.  I am including this so that you can check whether you have completed all parts.  Note in particular that for some reason the moodle lessons sometimes skip the reflective writing items (I haven't figured out why), so this map helps you figure out where those should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/lesson_map_meas_uncert.png" width="770" height="591" alt="lesson map" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose one of the following lesson parts.  When you have finished that part of the lesson you will be brought back to this page.  When you have finished all parts of the lesson click the "OK, I'm done" button to end the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to watch the lectures in order, but lecture 3 will make more sense after lecture 2.  Also, there is something that you are asked to do after lecture 2 which you should have already done before you watch lecture 4.  So, overall, things will be simpler if you watch the lectures in the suggested order.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>Units for pressure</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;This question is just about unit analysis, so don't worry that some of the quantities we are using are unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will encounter pressure in other courses, especially if you are in certain of the technology programs where you will take some fluids courses.  Here is one equation which gives a pressure (this is pressure within a stationary fluid)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\Delta P = \rho g h $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where ΔP is a pressure change, ρ is a density (in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), g is an acceleration and h is a height (distance).  From this, determine the correct units of pressure in terms of base SI units.&lt;/p&gt;

            <response>Yuck!  That isn't even metric.  We are in an advanced nation that uses SI, not a primitive backwater (like a certain neighbour to the south) which still clings to antiquated units.  Anyway, you couldn't have got that from the information given, so either you just knew that psi are a unit of pressure or you googled the answer.  If you googled it I'd just like to point out that you aren't helping your own learning by trying to look up answers to things that you are supposed to find yourself.</response>

            <response>No.  It is likely that either you are dropping the final "0" because you've been taught you "always can" or you are mixed up with the sig. fig. rule for multiplication.  But in writing measurements we write all digits that we know, even if they are zero.  The sig. fig. rule for addition tells us that we do know the 2nd digit after the decimal place, so we should write it, even though it is zero.</response>

        <title>Reflect on what you have learned</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Take out a piece of paper.  Write "PHYS 1101 - Response to Unit 1 Video Lectures" across the top of the paper and put your name in an upper corner of the page.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a big heading saying "First Half".  Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In your own words, explain the difference between leading zeros and trailing zeros.  Which ones are significant figures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will add more to this sheet after one of the other lectures in this unit.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>There are two problems with this answer.  One is that you've used the standard deviation as the uncertainty in the mean.  But you should use the SDOM (it wasn't given but you can easily calculate it).  The second problem is that you are not correctly applying the significant figures rules.</response>

        <title>Reflect on what you have learned (final summary)</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after watching Lecture 2.  If you don't already have that (perhaps because you are watching the videos out of sequence) then go back to Lecture 2, watch it, answer the questions and then start your writing.  Then come back to this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for Lecture 2 write a heading saying "End of Lectures".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question beyond the lecture: Ask a question that goes beyond what was covered in the lectures.  This could be a question about a topic that you think might be related to the lectures, or something that you suspect might be a more advanced topic that the material in these lectures might eventually lead to.  Or it might be something that I mentioned briefly, but didn't go into detail on.  Make your question as specific as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Attempt to explain (conceptually) the difference between the uncertainty in each measurement vs. the uncertainty in the best estimate.  You may find this a difficult distinction to explain, but take your best shot at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will scan this sheet, along with an addition to your cheat sheet, and submit it on moodle under the Written Response for this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>All reflections</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;This is only here so that if the Lesson navigation failed and you couldn't access one of the Reflective Writing pages you can view their content here.  Most of the time there should be no need for you to visit this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------After Lecture 2-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take out a piece of paper.  Write "PHYS 1101 - Response to Unit 1 Video Lectures" across the top of the paper and put your name in an upper corner of the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a big heading saying "First Half".  Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In your own words, explain the difference between leading zeros and trailing zeros.  Which ones are significant figures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will add more to this sheet after one of the other lectures in this unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;------------After Lecture 4-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after watching Lectures 1-2.  If you don't already have that (perhaps because you are watching the videos out of sequence) then go back to Lecture 2, watch it, answer the questions and then start your writing.  Then come back to this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for Lectures 1-2 write a heading saying "End of Lesson". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question beyond the lecture: Ask a question that goes beyond what was covered in the lectures.  This could be a question about a topic that you think might be related to the lectures, or something that you suspect might be a more advanced topic that the material in these lectures might eventually lead to.  Or it might be something that I mentioned briefly, but didn't go into detail on.  Make your question as specific as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Attempt to explain (conceptually) the difference between the uncertainty in each measurement vs. the uncertainty in the best estimate.  You may find this a difficult distinction to explain, but take your best shot at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will scan this sheet, along with an addition to your cheat sheet, and submit it on moodle under the Written Response for this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>
