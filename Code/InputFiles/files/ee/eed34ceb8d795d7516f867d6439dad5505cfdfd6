Metal balls A, B and C are charged in various ways.  Once charged it is found that A and B repel each other and that B and C also repel each other.  From this we can conclude that

All three metal balls carry charges of the same sign.
:ANSWER2:0:H
A and C have charges of the same sign, but B has the opposite sign.
:ANSWER3:0:H
A and B have charges of opposite sign, and B and C have charges of the opposite sign.
:ANSWER4:0:H
One of the balls has zero charge.
:ANSWER5:0:H
We would have to do more tests to determine anything about the charges.

You rub an ebonite rod with fur so that it is charged.  You touch it to a ping-pong ball wrapped in aluminum foil that is hanging from the ceiling by an electrically insulating thread.  You now rub the ebonite rod again and touch it to another aluminum-wrapped ping-pong ball.  When the two ping-pong balls are brought close together

there is no force between them.
:ANSWER4:0:H
there may be a force between them, but we cannot know without knowing more about the charges on each.

Two small metal spheres (approximately point charges) have been charged with unknown charges.  They are placed 0.10 m apart and it is found that they exert an attractive force of 1.0 N on each other.

:QUESTION:H
A ping-pong ball wrapped in aluminum foil is very lightweight, but has a surface that is a good electrical conductor.  You give an ebonite rod a negative charge by rubbing it with fur.  You then bring it close to a ping-pong ball wrapped in foil which is hanging from an electically insulating string.  Which statement describes the behaviour of the charges on the aluminum foil wrapped ping-pong ball?

:ANSWERORDER:randomized
:INDICES:letters
:ANSWER1:100:H
Some of the electrons on the ping-pong ball will be pushed from the side near to the ebonite rod to the side far from the ebonite rod.
:ANSWER2:0:H
Some of the electrons on the ping-pong ball will be pulled from the side far from the ebonite rod to the side near to the ebonite rod.
:ANSWER3:0:H
Some of the protons on the ping-pong ball will be pulled from the side far from the ebonite rod to the side near to the ebonite rod.
:ANSWER4:0:H
Some of the electrons on the ping-pong ball will be pushed from out of the ball and into the ground.
:ANSWER5:0:H
Nothing will happen to the charges on the ping-pong ball unless it is actually touched with the rod.
