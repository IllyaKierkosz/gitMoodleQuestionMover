\begin{itemize}

\item If you have questions about this assignment you should stop by my office, email me, or join in a discussion on the Moodle message boards.

\item Remember, there are far more marks for procedure than for final answers.  Write your solutions neatly and in a well organized fashion.  Show all work.

\item All work submitted must be your own work.  You are encouraged to work with other students but do not show each other the final work that you intend to submit.  If you collaborate with other students it is a good idea to cite them as sources for your work.

\section*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Chapter 28, Problem 24.

\item Chapter 28, Problem 26.

\item Chapter 28, Problem 36.

\item Chapter 28, Problem 80.

\item A spherical drop of water is charged to 40 pC (pico-Coulombs). The potential difference between the surface of the drop and infinity is 500 V. What is the radius of the drop? Two drops like the one just described (same radius, charge, etc ...) were combined into a new spherical drop. What is the new potential at the surface? 

\item Electrons can be ``boiled off'' of a wire by heating the wire to sufficiently high temperature (typically well over 1000 $^\circ$C).  Typically the electrons leave the wire with a fairly low speed which can be approximated as zero.  In many devices where this is done the hot wire is also maintained at some voltage which causes the electrons to accelerate away from the wire.

Suppose electrons are boiled off of a wire that is held at an unknown voltage.  The electrons accelerate away and eventually hit a metal plate which is grounded.  By convention we define the grounded plate as having $V = 0$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Is the voltage at the hot wire positive or negative?  Explain.

\item There are various ways that we could measure the speed of the electrons as they impact the grounded plate.  Suppose we determine that the electrons have a speed of $2.96 \times 10^7$ m/s just before hitting the plate.  What is the voltage at the hot wire?

\end{enumerate}

\item Figure~\ref{fig:pot_diff_closed_path} shows several points which form a closed path ABCDA.  The potential differences are noted where a sign convention is established $\Delta V_{ab} = V_{a} - V_{b}$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find the potential difference $\Delta V_{DC}$.

\item A $-2$ nC charge starts at point B.  Think of this charge plus the source charges for the voltages in this region to be ``the system''.  We can use some other external forces to move the charge (perhaps it is mounted on the end of an insulating stick so that we can push it around).  As you move the charge at a small constant speed from B to A to D to C and finally back to B, how much work is done on the charge by electrical forces during each portion of the journey?  How much work is done by the external forces during each portion of the journey?  Summarize these numbers in a table.

\item Where does the $-2$ nC charge have zero electrical potential energy?

\item Set a potential energy convention (the convention is entirely up to you) and then tabulate the values of the charge's electrical potential energy at each of points A, B, C, D.

\end{enumerate}

\item Figure~\ref{fig:two_charges_point} shows two identical charges separated by a distance, $d$, and a point, A, that is a distance, $r$, from the midpoint between the charges. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find the voltage at point A as a function of the distance, $r$.

\item Use some plotting software (like Excel) to plot $V(r)$.  Use $q = 1$ C and $d = 1$ m for this plot. On the same plot, plot the function $1/r$. 

\item Find an expression for $V(r)$ as $r \to \infty$.  At what value of $r$ does your expression for $V(r)$ as $r \to \infty$ look like your expression for the voltage at point A (from part a))?

\item Suppose a charge $q_{probe}$ is placed very near to the midpoint between these two charges and on the bisecting line between them.  It is of opposite charge to the two charges, $q$.  Sketch what the potential energy would look like around $r = 0$. The potential energy can be written in the form $U \propto r^{n}$. Reason what the value of $n$ is. You have seen potential energies shaped like this before. What other physical system has a potential energy like this?
