:QUESTION:H
A metal ball is placed in a region between parallel plates.  It does not make contact with either plate.

:ANSWER1:100:H
The field lines are perpendicular to the ball's surface.  The surface of the ball is an equipotential surface.
:ANSWER2:0:H
The equipotential surfaces are perpendicular to the surface of the ball.  The field lines are parallel (tangent) to the ball's surface.

The field is zero just outside the ball.  The potential is zero on the surface of the ball.
:ANSWER4:0:H
The field lines will bend to avoid the ball.  The equipotential surfaces also bend to avoid the ball.
