For each of the drop down lists in the paragraph below choose the option that most correctly completes the paragraph.<br /><br />Two parallel plates are connected to a battery so that one is at a potential of 1.5 V and the other is at 0 V. The equipotential surfaces between the plates are {1:MULTICHOICE:cirles centered on the plates~=parallel planes parallel to the plates~circles centered on the plates~parallel planes perpendicular to the plates} . The electric field lines between the plates {1:MULTICHOICE:are parallel lines pointing from the 0 V to the 1.5 V plate~=are parallel lines pointing from the 1.5 V plate to the 0 V plate~are parallel lines pointing parallel to the plates~point outward from both plates}.<br />]]></text>

For each of the drop down lists in the paragraph below choose the option that most correctly completes the paragraph.<br /><br />A small conducting ball has a positive net charge. No other charged objects are nearby. The equipotential surfaces near the ball are {1:MULTICHOICE:parallel planes~circles centered on the ball~cylinders centered on the ball~=spheres centered on the ball} . The electric field lines near the ball {1:MULTICHOICE:point directly towards the ball~=point directly away from the ball~loop from one side of the sphere around to the other~are parallel lines}.<br />]]></text>
