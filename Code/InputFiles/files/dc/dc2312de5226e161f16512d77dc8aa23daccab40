A thin, square sheet of acrylic, about 10 cm on each side, is lying flat on a table top.  It was recently rubbed with wool and has picked up a uniform charge density on its surface as a result.  As the text says, if we are very near a surface then we can approximate the surface as an infinite plane.  If we test the electric field strength at a point 0.1 mm from the surface and test it again 0.2 mm from the surface we should find that

:ANSWER1:100:H
The field strength at 0.2 mm is about the same as the field strength at 0.1 mm.
:ANSWER2:0:H
The field strength at 0.2 mm is significantly less than the field strength at 0.1 mm.
:ANSWER3:0:H
The field strength at 0.2 mm is significantly more than the field strength at 0.1 mm.
