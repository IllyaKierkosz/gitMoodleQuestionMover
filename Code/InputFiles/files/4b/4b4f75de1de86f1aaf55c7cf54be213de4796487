\begin{itemize}

\item If you have questions about this assignment you should stop by my office, email me, or join in a discussion on the Moodle message boards.

\item Remember, there are far more marks for procedure than for final answers.  Write your solutions neatly and in a well organized fashion.  Show all work.

\item All work submitted must be your own work.  You are encouraged to work with other students but do not show each other the final work that you intend to submit.  If you collaborate with other students it is a good idea to cite them as sources for your work.

\section*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item A 125 cm length of string has a mass of 2 g. It is stretched with a tension of 8 N between two fixed supports. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the wave speed along the string?
\item What is the lowest resonant frequency of the string? 
\item What are the three longest wavelengths for traveling waves along the string that can support standing waves? 
\item Sketch the standing waves for part c and identify the nodes and antinodes. 

\end{enumerate}


\item Two wires, one steel and one aluminum, have the same cross-sectional area ($= 1 \times 10^{-2}$ cm$^{2}$) and are joined together as shown in Figure \ref{fig:two_wires}. The length of the aluminum wire is $L_{1} = 60$ cm and the length of the steel wire is $L_{2} = 86$ cm. The densities of aluminum and steel are 2.6 g cm$^{-3}$ and 7.8 g cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The mass hanging from the pulley in Figure \ref{fig:two_wires} is 10 kg. Waves are set up along the wire so that a node is located at the pulley. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the lowest frequency that can excite a standing wave in the wires with a node at the place where the wires join? 
\item How many nodes are observed? 

\end{enumerate}

\item A narrow pipe is open ended and is placed next to a speaker in a room at 20$^\circ$ C.  The signal source driving the speaker has adjustable frequency.  However, like all such sources it only produces a clean signal over a limited frequency range.  The column of air in the pipe is found to resonate at 90 Hz, 120 Hz, 150 Hz and 180 Hz, but not at any frequencies between these.  Because of the limitations of the signal source it cannot be conclusively tested outside of this range.

\begin{enumerate}

\item What other frequencies will this pipe resonate at?  In particular, if we had a source that would produce a clean signal at low frequencies, what is the lowest frequency at which the pipe would resonate?

\item Which harmonics of the pipe are 90 Hz, 120 Hz, 150 Hz and 180 Hz?

\item How long is the pipe?

\item If we seal one end of the pipe, what frequencies will it resonate at?

\end{enumerate}



\item Two speakers, A and B, are separated by 2 m and are each generating a tone at 680 Hz. A person is standing 3.0 m directly in front of A. As the person begins to walk directly away from the A they occasionally hit quiet spots along their path. At what distances from speaker A do these quiet spots occur? Assume that the air in the room is at 20 $^{\circ}$C.


\item Light of a certain wavelength causes an interference pattern when passed through two small slits separated by 0.20 mm. The screen that the interference pattern is projected on is 60 cm from the slits and the distance between the first and fifth minima on the screen is 6.0 mm. What is the wavelength of the light used in the experiment in nm (nano-meters)? What color is that light? 

\item A Michelson interferometer uses light of wavelength 602.446 nm. Mirror 2 is slowly moved while exactly 33,198 bright-dark-bright fringes are observed. What distance has mirror 2 moved? 

\item A tsunami, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tsunami} is approaching a coastline.  North is at top in the diagram.  Because of earlier interactions with other coasts the tsunami here is a sequence of waves of wavelength 5 km.  There is a chain of islands 80 km out from the coast which has two gaps in it, separated by 12.5 km.  At point A, 13 km directly inside one gap, is a very small island (small enough that it has a negligible effect on the waves themselves).

\begin{enumerate}

\item Is the island at point A at a nodal or an antinodal point in the interference pattern that develops as the waves come through the gaps?

\item The point B on the coastline will experience maximum wave heights because of interference.  Find all of the other points northward along the coastline from B that will experience maximum wave heights.  Note that the coastline is quite far from the islands compared to the distance between the islands and so there are certain approximations that you can use.  Show the reasoning that leads to an expression that you can use.  In arriving at your predictions note what approximations you have made.  As usual, a diagram will probably be useful in explaining your reasoning.
