This question may sound suspiciously like a fluid flow question, and conceptually it is very similar.  A wire is shown which widens from a thin section to a thick section.  A number N<sub>e</sub> electrons pass through a cross section of the thin wire in a second.  The number passing through a cross section of the thick section of wire per second should be

:ANSWERORDER:randomized
:INDICES:letters
:ANSWER1:100:H
The electrons suffer frequent collisions with the atoms in the wire and their net displacement is zero in the absence of an electric field.
:ANSWER2:0:H
With no push from the electric field the electrons stop moving.
:ANSWER3:0:H
The electrons collide more often with the atoms in the wire once the field is turned off so they can't get anywhere.
:ANSWER4:0:H
With no electric field, gravity dominates and the electrons just "pool" in the bottom surface of the wire.
