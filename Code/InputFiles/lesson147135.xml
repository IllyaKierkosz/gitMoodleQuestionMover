        <title>Main page - choose lesson part</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Here is a "map" of the lesson.  I am including this so that you can check whether you have completed all parts.  Note in particular that for some reason the moodle lessons sometimes skip the reflective writing items (I haven't figured out why), so this map helps you figure out where those should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/lesson_map_Ns_laws.png" width="600" height="379" alt="lesson map" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose one of the following lesson parts.  When you have finished that part of the lesson you will be brought back to this page.  When you have finished all parts of the lesson click the "OK, I'm done" button to end the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>No.  It is a common misconception that normal forces act upward, because they very frequently do act straight upward.  Remember that "normal" means "perpendicular".</response>

            <response>No. This is perpendicular to the surface.  But a normal force is always a "push".  The surface does not pull the object onto itself.  It pushes to keep the object from "falling through the surface".</response>

            <response>No.  Not falling through the floor requires that the acceleration of the box is zero.  If the normal force is greater than the weight then the net force is not zero and the box will accelerate.</response>

            <response>No.  The *net* force on the box is zero.  But this just means that all of the forces acting on the box add up to zero.  There is certainly a weight acting down on the box.  If that was the only force acting on the box then it would accelerate down.  So there must be a nonzero normal force acting on the box.</response>

            <answer_text>The normal force is equal to the strength of the floor.</answer_text>
            <response>Is "the strength of the floor" a force?  It is certainly possible to quantify the strength of the floor.  But we haven't discussed this.  Also, if the normal force is "equal to the strength of the floor" wouldn't this mean that the floor would break if the box was any heavier?  This sounds like a dangerous situation indeed!</response>

            <response>No.  The *net* force is zero, but this is very different from the tension being zero.  It means that the sum of all the forces acting on the light is zero.  There is certainly a downward weight force.  For the net force to be zero this must be counteracted by a non-zero tension force.</response>

            <response>No.  You probably just used \( f_s = \mu_s n \).  But that tells you the maximum value of the static friction.  The actual value in any case is found from Newton's 2nd law.</response>

            <response>No, the net force is zero.  But this is because the friction force balances the force that you exert on the table.</response>

        <title>All reflections</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;This is only here so that if the Lesson navigation failed and you couldn't access one of the Reflective Writing pages you can view their content here.  Most of the time there should be no need for you to visit this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------After Lecture 3-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take out a piece of paper.  Write "PHYS 1101 - Response to Unit 6 Video Lectures" across the top of the paper and put your name in an upper corner of the page.  Write a big heading saying "Lectures 1-3".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In general, when we think that a friction force acts on some object, how do we decide whether that friction force is static friction or kinetic friction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will add more to this sheet after some of the other lectures in this unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;------------After Lecture 5-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after watching Lecture 3.  If you don't already have that (perhaps because you are watching the videos out of sequence) then go back to Lecture 3, watch it, answer the questions and then start your writing.  Then come back to this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for Lecture 3 write a heading saying "End of Lectures".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question beyond the lecture: Ask a question that goes beyond what was covered in the lectures.  This could be a question about a topic that you think might be related to the lectures, or something that you suspect might be a more advanced topic that the material in these lectures might eventually lead to.  Or it might be something that I mentioned briefly, but didn't go into detail on.  Make your question as specific as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Suppose a car is &lt;strong&gt;going east&lt;/strong&gt;, and it is speeding up.  Its wheels are &lt;strong&gt;not slipping&lt;/strong&gt;.  (If it's wheels slip then you would hear a loud "SCREEEEEECH" from the tires rubbing on the road.  Assume that is not happening.)  Does static or kinetic friction act on the  car?  Explain how you know.  Which way does the static or kinetic friction act?  Explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will scan this sheet, along with an addition to your cheat sheet, and submit it on moodle under the Written Response for this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflect on what you have learned (final summary)</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after watching Lecture 3.  If you don't already have that (perhaps because you are watching the videos out of sequence) then go back to Lecture 3, watch it, answer the questions and then start your writing.  Then come back to this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for Lecture 3 write a heading saying "End of Lectures".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question beyond the lecture: Ask a question that goes beyond what was covered in the lectures.  This could be a question about a topic that you think might be related to the lectures, or something that you suspect might be a more advanced topic that the material in these lectures might eventually lead to.  Or it might be something that I mentioned briefly, but didn't go into detail on.  Make your question as specific as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Suppose a car is &lt;strong&gt;going east&lt;/strong&gt;, and it is speeding up.  Its wheels are &lt;strong&gt;not slipping&lt;/strong&gt;.  (If it's wheels slip then you would hear a loud "SCREEEEEECH" from the tires rubbing on the road.  Assume that is not happening.)  Does static or kinetic friction act on the  car?  Explain how you know.  Which way does the static or kinetic friction act?  Explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will scan this sheet, along with an addition to your cheat sheet, and submit it on moodle under the Written Response for this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>Effect of pulling up</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You have a 5 kg block with a string attached to it.  You can push the block across the floor at constant speed with your foot.  If you instead push the block across the floor at constant speed while pulling straight up on the string what happens?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>Yes.  Pulling up on the string will reduce the strength of the normal force, which in turn reduces the strength of the frictional force.  So you don't have to push as hard.</response>

        <title>Reflect on what you have learned</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Take out a piece of paper.  Write "PHYS 1101 - Response to Unit 6 Video Lectures" across the top of the paper and put your name in an upper corner of the page.  Write a big heading saying "Lectures 1-3".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In general, when we think that a friction force acts on some object, how do we decide whether that friction force is static friction or kinetic friction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will add more to this sheet after some of the other lectures in this unit.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>
