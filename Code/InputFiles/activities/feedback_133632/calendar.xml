    <name>Survey to find  best date for a review session opens</name>
    <description>&lt;div class="no-overflow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will use this survey to find the best date for a review session.  Note that it is unlikely that we can find a time that will work for everyone.  If we end up selecting a time that doesn't work for you then I suggest that you work through things in your studying (sample exam, etc.) then find some time to visit me in my office to go over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we pick one of the days on Dec. 10 or later I will have to remove availability of some one-on-one appointment time slots to make room for the review session.  Or the review session might need to be a bit short.  It might make sense to do two short review session on different days rather than one long one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
