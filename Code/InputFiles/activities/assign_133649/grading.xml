        <name>Lesson written response and cheat sheet rubric</name>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the rubric I will use to assign a mark to your written response and your cheat sheet.  These marks are essentially just for doing the work, so the marking scheme is intentionally very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common reason to not receive full marks for the written response is that the response is simply incomplete.  You should have answered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partway through the lesson:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point of confusion (Explain something which at least initially unclear to you.  If you resolved your confusion then explain the thought process which clarified things for you.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question beyond the lesson (Ask a question related to the material in the lesson, but which goes beyond what was covered in the lesson.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A third question (specific to the lesson)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the lesson:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point of confusion (Explain something which at least initially unclear to you.  If you resolved your confusion then explain the thought process which clarified things for you.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something you have seen before (Identify something in the lesson which was familiar, or which was in some way related to things you have seen before.  Say where you saw it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A third question (specific to the lesson)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, "Nothing confused me," is not an acceptable answer to the Point of confusion.  This would imply that if you wrote an exam on the material right now you would get 100%.  Do you believe that?  I don't...  Similarly, saying  that everything in the lesson was new as an answer to identifying something you have seen before is not acceptable.  You never learn new things that are not in some way connected to things you already know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly on the cheat sheet, I am simply looking for you to have put down a few things from the lesson which you think will be useful to you on assignments and exams.  I have no firm ideas about how many "a few" is.  But realize that the goal here is for you to construct a cheat sheet that &lt;strong&gt;you will find useful&lt;/strong&gt;.  So if you put in barely any effort you are mostly shooting yourself in the foot.&lt;/p&gt;
