        <title>Reflect before you start</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;This lesson is called Interactions, because up until now we have not looked in detail at how objects interact - we have just observed that interactions cause objects to accelerate.  Now we will start to look more at the nature of interactions between objects.  The lesson will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of internal energy (potential energy, thermal energy, source energy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissipative and non-dissipative interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extending the Law of Conservation of Energy to include more detail about types of energy that a system might have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using knowledge of potential energy to make predictions about the accelerations of objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start to look at any complicated content, whether it is a textbook, a set of video lectures, a web page, whatever, it is a good idea to prepare to learn by doing a bit of reflection.  To develop the habit it is good to write some reflections.  In the space below write three things (sentences, point form, whatever you want) about what you are about to learn.  Here are some things you might write about below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you think you might learn about in the lesson (in more detail than was given in the list above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you already know about the topics of this lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you have heard about these topics, but don't understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</contents>

        <title>Main page - choose lesson part</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You do not have to finish the lesson all in one sitting.  You may reattempt it if you are not satisfied with how you did.  Here is a "map" of the lesson.  This is partly because moodle has a tendency (which I haven't figured out) to skip the Reflective Writing parts of these lessons.  This map will help you see if you have missed any and find your way to where they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/lesson_map_interactions.png" width="952" height="598" alt="lesson map" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose one of the following lesson parts.  When you have finished that part of the lesson you will be brought back to this page.  When you have finished all parts of the lesson click the "OK, I'm done" button to end the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <response>No.  This would imply that the car is able to spring back to its original shape (i.e. that the process of deformation of the car during the collision is a reversible process).  That would be very convenient for the owner of the car, but is not the case.</response>

        <title>Energy conversion during collision between train car and spring</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Where railway tracks end (such as in switching yards) there are often very large spring-loaded bumpers at the end of the track to prevent railway cars from rolling off the end of the tracks.  A railway car rolls slowly into one of these bumpers causing the spring to be compressed.  The spring then uncompresses and pushes the car away at nearly the speed that it was going before it hit the bumper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of the following is the most correct description of the energy conversions which take place during the process of the train car bouncing off of the bumper?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>Kinetic energy is converted to spring potential energy.  But then (most of it) is not converted to thermal energy.  Notice that the train car is moving at the nearly the same speed after colliding with the bumper as it was before.  So very little energy was lost to dissipation.</response>

        <title>Reflect on what you have learned (final summary)</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after the first half of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for the first half of the lesson write a heading saying "End of Lectures".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Under that answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Some closed system consists of two objects which interact with each other nondissipatively.  Explain how we know that in a system like this the system's potential energy is a function of the relative position of the two objects only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>Where does energy to raise book come from?</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;A book is resting on a table.  You pick it up and lift it to a high shelf.  When you pick up the book you increase its gravitational potential energy.  The law of conservation of energy requires that the energy to do this comes from somewhere.  Where did it come from?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>No.  The table may have been *slightly* bent (reversibly deformed) by supporting the book.  But this wasn't enough stored energy to lift the book to the shelf.  Otherwise the table would have launched the book up onto the shelf and you wouldn't have had to lift it at all.</response>

        <title>burning methane to compress spring</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;A cylinder has a piston and large spring in it.  As shown, a mixture of fuel and oxygen in the cylinder burns rapidly.  The expanding gases push down on the piston and compress the spring.  The system is the fuel/oxygen mixture, the spring and the piston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of the following is the best description of the energy conversion which takes place in this process?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

&lt;p&gt;----------First Half-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take out a piece of paper.  Write "PHYS 1104 - Response to Unit 7 Video Lectures" across the top of the paper.  &lt;strong&gt;Don't put your name on it&lt;/strong&gt;; I would rather mark "blind".  Write a big heading saying "First Half".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question beyond the lecture: Ask a question that goes beyond what was covered in the lectures.  This could be a question about a topic that you think might be related to the lectures, or something that you suspect might be a more advanced topic that the material in these lectures might eventually lead to.  Or it might be something that I mentioned briefly, but didn't go into detail on.  Make your question as specific as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Give several (say, 2 to 4) examples of interactions which occur in everyday life.  For each interaction, describe what category of energy is converted to what other category of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will add more to this sheet after one of the other lectures in this unit.  You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;------------End of Lesson-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after the first half of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for the first half of the lesson write a heading saying "End of Lectures".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Some closed system consists of two objects which interact with each other nondissipatively.  Explain how we know that in a system like this the system's potential energy is a function of the relative position of the two objects only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>Effect of moving mass and spring</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;A mass is hanging by a spring which is suspended from a support.  You carefully lift the support of the spring higher so that the mass and spring are now higher up.  You did this slowly and carefully so that the spring did not lengthen or compress during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How has the spring potential energy of the system changed during this process?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>
