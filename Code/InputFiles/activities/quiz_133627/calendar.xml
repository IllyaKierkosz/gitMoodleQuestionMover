    <description>&lt;div class="no-overflow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will have 35 minutes to complete this.  It is all conceptual questions.  Any calculations involved will be no more complicated than adding or multiplying  a couple of numbers together, but the vast majority of questions should involve no calculation at all.  You can click back into questions that you have already seen using the navigation area on the left, so feel free to leave questions unanswered and come back to them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should not try to rush through this.  You have plenty of time.  If you finish and have lots of time  left then I highly suggest you look back through your answers and continue thinking  about them.  There is no prize for the person who finishes earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will not be able to review the exam immediately after it is finished.  I will need to make sure that everybody finished it and that there were no technical difficulties.  There may be one or more questions which will require manual marking by me.  This might take me as long as  a day depending on how things went.  After I have made sure that everything is OK I will release the exam and you will be able to look back through it to get feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
