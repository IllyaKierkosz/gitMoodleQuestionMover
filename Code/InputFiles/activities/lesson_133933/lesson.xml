        <title>Reflect before you start</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;This lesson is called Circular Motion.  It will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circular motion at constant speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circular motion with varying speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forces acting on objects in circular motion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start to look at any complicated content, whether it is a textbook, a set of video lectures, a web page, whatever, it is a good idea to prepare to learn by doing a bit of reflection.  To develop the habit it is good to write some reflections.  In the space below write three things (sentences, point form, whatever you want) about what you are about to learn.  Here are some things you might write about below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you think you might learn about in the lesson (in more detail than was given in the list above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you already know about the topics of this lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you have heard about these topics, but don't understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</contents>

        <title>Main page - choose lesson part</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You do not have to finish the lesson all in one sitting.  You may reattempt it if you are not satisfied with how you did.  Here is a "map" of the lesson.  This is partly because moodle has a tendency (which I haven't figured out) to skip the Reflective Writing parts of these lessons.  This map will help you see if you have missed any and find your way to where they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/lesson_map_circular_motion.png" width="795" height="704" alt="Lesson Map" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose one of the following lesson parts.  When you have finished that part of the lesson you will be brought back to this page.  When you have finished all parts of the lesson click the "OK, I'm done" button to end the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>direction of net force on person in roller coaster</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You are riding a roller coaster which has a loop. At the instant that you pass through the top of the loop you are at a minimum speed, so you are neither speeding up nor slowing down.  So we can treat this moment as uniform circular motion.  Which way is the vector sum of forces on you at this moment?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>No.  This is uniform circular motion (just like the car at the bottom of the valley in the lecture).  At the top of the loop the centre of the circle is below you.  So the vector sum of forces is down.</response>

            <answer_text>forward (i.e. in the direction of your motion)</answer_text>
            <response>No, you may have a persistent confusion between velocity and acceleration.  We have seen (draw the motion diagram) that in uniform circular motion the acceleration points toward the centre of the circle.  Newton's 2nd Law tells us that the net force acts in the same direction as the acceleration.  So the vector sum of forces acts down since that is the direction to the centre of the circle.</response>

            <response>No.  Are you thinking that the speed is constant so the acceleration should be zero?  Acceleration is rate of change of velocity, and the direction of the velocity is changing.  So the acceleration is not zero and neither is the vector sum of forces.</response>

        <title>Vertical circle</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Think about the part of the video where I was swinging the ball around on the string.  Suppose I swing it in a vertical circle in front of me instead of a horizontal circle above my head.  As the ball passes through the bottom of the circle it is at its maximum speed and so it is neither speeding up nor slowing down.  Thus, we can treat that moment as uniform circular motion.  Which way is the vector sum of forces on it at this instant?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>No.  At the instant the ball is passing through the bottom of the circle the direction to the centre of the circle is up.  So the vector sum of forces would point up.</response>

            <answer_text>In the direction of motion</answer_text>
            <response>You may have a persistent misunderstanding leading you to think that the vector sum of forces is always in the direction of motion.  Remember that the Law of Inertia tells us that no force is needed to keep an object in motion.  A motion diagram would show you that the acceleration at this moment is up, and so the vector sum of forces must also be up.</response>

            <answer_text>Since the speed isn't changing the acceleration is zero and so is the vector sum of forces.</answer_text>
            <response>Acceleration is not rate of change of speed.  It is rate of change of velocity.   A motion diagram would show you that the acceleration at this moment is up, and so the vector sum of forces must also be up.</response>

        <title>Reflect on what you have learned (final summary)</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after the first half of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for the first half of the lesson write a heading saying "End of Lectures".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Think back over the &lt;strong&gt;whole course&lt;/strong&gt;.  It might be helpful to pull your other written responses and look over the points of confusion on them.  What is the thing that we have learned in this course that is the least clear to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>ants on turntable (speed)</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Two ants are standing still on a turntable (in case you don't know, a turntable is an ancient device used to play "records" which were an audio recording format used in antiquity). The turntable is turning. Ant A is 1.0 cm from the center of the turntable. Ant B is 5.0 cm from the center of the turntable. Which ant has the greater speed?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>No.  Both ants complete a "trip around the circle" in the same amount of time (the same amount of time it takes for the turntable to go around once).  So their *periods* are the same and their angular speeds are the same.  But the question asked about speed, not period or angular speed.  Ant B travels further in that time because it is going around a larger circle, so it is going faster.</response>

            <response>Relative to the turntable they are stationary.  But if you were on a merry go round which was turning I doubt you would describe yourself as stationary.  We are talking about the ants' speeds relative to the ground, which is certainly not zero.</response>

            <response>We do have enough information to conclude which ant travels further.  Both ants complete a "trip around the circle" in the same amount of time (the same amount of time it takes for the turntable to go around once).  Ant B travels further in that time because it is going around a larger circle, so it is going faster.  We can't *calculate* their speeds with the information given but we certainly know which is going faster.</response>

        <title>Reflect on what you have learned</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Take out a piece of paper.  Write "PHYS 1104 - Response to Unit 10 Video Lectures" across the top of the paper.  &lt;strong&gt;Don't put your name on it&lt;/strong&gt;; I would rather mark "blind".  Write a big heading saying "First Half".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question beyond the lecture: Ask a question that goes beyond what was covered in the lectures.  This could be a question about a topic that you think might be related to the lectures, or something that you suspect might be a more advanced topic that the material in these lectures might eventually lead to.  Or it might be something that I mentioned briefly, but didn't go into detail on.  Make your question as specific as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In your own words, explain the differences between angular acceleration, tangential acceleration and radial acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will add more to this sheet after one of the other lectures in this unit.  You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>Did you think that the angular acceleration is negative because the disk is slowing down?  Just like with acceleration components earlier in the course, the sign of the angular acceleration does not tell you whether the object is speeding up or slowing down.  Think of what the angular velocity vs. time graph must look like and decide whether it has a positive or negative slope.</response>

            <response>No.  Counterclockwise is positive and the disk is rotating clockwise.  Also, did you think that angular acceleration is negative because the disk is slowing down?  That's not what the sign of angular acceleration tells you.</response>

            <response>No.  Part of the point of using radians is that in most situations we don't have annoying factors of pi floating around because of it.  A radius is 20 m. The person has walked 80 m, which is the equivalent of 4 radii.  So they have walked through an angle of 4 rad.</response>

            <response>No.  Part of the point of using radians is that in most situations we don't have annoying factors of pi floating around because of it.  A radius is 5 m.  Every second this object goes 15 m, which is the equivalent of 3 radii.  So the angular speed is 3 rad/s.</response>

            <response>Please use common sense.  In a race the person who completes the race in less time must have run faster.  Amy took less time to go around the circle so she must have been running faster.  They have gone the same distance.  Amy did it in less time.  By the definition of speed she must have gone faster.</response>

        <title>All reflections</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;This is only here so that if the Lesson navigation failed and you couldn't access one of the Reflective Writing pages you can view their content here.  Most of the time there should be no need for you to visit this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------First Half-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take out a piece of paper.  Write "PHYS 1104 - Response to Unit 10 Video Lectures" across the top of the paper.  &lt;strong&gt;Don't put your name on it&lt;/strong&gt;; I would rather mark "blind".  Write a big heading saying "First Half".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question beyond the lecture: Ask a question that goes beyond what was covered in the lectures.  This could be a question about a topic that you think might be related to the lectures, or something that you suspect might be a more advanced topic that the material in these lectures might eventually lead to.  Or it might be something that I mentioned briefly, but didn't go into detail on.  Make your question as specific as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In your own words, explain the differences between angular acceleration, tangential acceleration and radial acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will add more to this sheet after one of the other lectures in this unit.  You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /&gt;------------End of Lesson-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after the first half of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for the first half of the lesson write a heading saying "End of Lectures".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Think back over the &lt;strong&gt;whole course&lt;/strong&gt;.  It might be helpful to pull your other written responses and look over the points of confusion on them.  What is the thing that we have learned in this course that is the least clear to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>The acceleration cannot be zero.  Acceleration is not rate of change of speed.  It is rate of change of velocity.  The velocity is changing direction, so the acceleration is not zero.
Also, the velocity you chose is not correct.  At the instant shown, which way is the mass going?</response>

            <response>No.  When the acceleration is in the same direction as the velocity it causes the object to speed up going in a straight line.  This object is moving in a curved path and it is going at constant speed.</response>
