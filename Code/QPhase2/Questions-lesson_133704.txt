The changes in slope on the graph are telling you about changes in the acceleration.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>The object's x-component of acceleration is increasing the during whole time shown.  It increases at an increasing rate from t = 0 until t = 3 s and it increases at an decreasing rate after t = 3 s.</answer_text>            <response>No.  The slope is telling you about the acceleration.  Notice that the graph is getting steeper early (the x-component of acceleration is increasing) but decreasing later (the x-component of acceleration is decreasing).</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>The object is speeding up from t = 0 until t = 3 s and slowing down after t = 3 s.  Around t = 6 s it stops.</answer_text>            <response>No you are interpreting the graph as if it was an x vs. t graph.</response>
