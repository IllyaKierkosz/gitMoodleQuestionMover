        <title>Bumping into spring</title>        <contents><p>Springs of various sorts are often used to "cushion" impacts to prevent damage to various objects.  In a factory a heavy cart full of boxes to be shipped is rolling along a horizontal track.  At the end of the track is a big spring which brings the cart gently to rest.  The system is the cart plus spring.  As the cart runs into the spring and compresses it what is the main energy transformation that is taking place in the system?</p></contents>

            <score>1</score>            <answer_text>It increased.  We know because kinetic energy of the dough must have been converted into another form within the system.</answer_text>            <response>Yes.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>It increased.  We know this because sound must have been produced during the collision between the dough and the wall.</answer_text>            <response>You are correct that it increased, but not about how we know.  Remember that we are talking about the dough-wall system.  The sound produced is something going on in the air, which is not part of the system, so it must represent some energy "leaving" the system.  So it doesn't tell us that the internal energy of the system increased.  What it does tell us is that the *total* energy of the system probably decreased, even if only slightly. </response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>It decreased.  We know this because the dough was moving before the collision and now it isn't.  Clearly kinetic energy has been lost.</answer_text>            <response>No.  Kinetic energy is not a type of internal energy.  It is a different category of energy.  You are correct that the kinetic energy decreased.  So, what happened to that "lost" kinetic energy...?</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>It decreased.  We know this because the dough compressed during the collision  (so the system size decreased) and internal energy is an extensive quantity.</answer_text>            <response>No, although that brings up subtle points about what we mean by "system size" when we talk about extensive quantities.  It is certainly possible that the dough was compressed during the collision.  But what we really mean by system size is "amount of matter", not volume.  The amount of dough did not change so the system size was unchanged.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>It stayed the same because energy is always conserved.</answer_text>            <response>Energy is always conserved, but it can be transformed from one form to another (as we will discuss in another few lectures).  So the amount of internal energy can change.  It just means that some other kind of energy also has to change to compensate.</response>
