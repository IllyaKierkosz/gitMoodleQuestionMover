        <title>Which are examples of academic misconduct?</title>        <contents><p>This will be quite similar to a question you answered in the Introduction to Academic Integrity course, but is more focused on things which are directly relevant to this course.  Which of the following are examples of academic misconduct (select all that apply)?</p></contents>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text><p>Copying another student's work</p></answer_text>            <response><p>Yes.  This is one of the most common forms of academic misconduct that I have seen in this course in the past.</p></response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text><p>Allowing another student to copy your work</p></answer_text>            <response><p>Yes. Help your fellow students. But don't damage their learning by doing their work for them.</p></response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text><p>Copying and pasting from an online source into any document that you are submitting for marks</p></answer_text>            <response><p>Yes.  This is not so common in this course since most work you submit will be hand-written.  But I have seen it at times.</p></response>

        <title>The Chegg  rule</title>        <contents><p>Scenario: You are working on Assignment #3 in this course.  One of your classmates texts you saying, "Someone has posted problem 2 on Chegg." You reply, "Is the answer posted?"  "Not yet," they reply.What should you do, and why?</p></contents>
            <score>1</score>            <answer_text><p>Keep working on the problem.  It may still be worth it to hand it in.</p></answer_text>            <response><p>Yes.  Depending on several factors I may decide that the problem will still count for marks, but if the solutions is posted I will carefully police submitted solutions to see whether anyone copied from Chegg.</p></response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text><p>Stop working on the problem since it won't count for marks.</p></answer_text>            <response><p>No.  It may still count for marks.  I will take several factors into consideration when I am deciding whether the question will count for marks or not.</p></response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text><p>Stop working on the question, find the question on Chegg and bookmark it so you can check back later to see if the solution is posted.  If a solution is posted, copy it down.</p></answer_text>            <response><p>That's plagiarism.  Don't do it.</p></response>
            <score>1</score>            <answer_text><p>Tell Geoff that the question has been posted.</p></answer_text>            <response><p>Sure.  I'll almost certainly find it myself, but I do appreciate it if you point it out to me and save me a bit of time.  But also, keep working on the question since it may still count for marks.</p></response>
