        <title>direction of net force on person in roller coaster</title>        <contents><p>You are riding a roller coaster which has a loop. At the instant that you pass through the top of the loop you are at a minimum speed, so you are neither speeding up nor slowing down.  So we can treat this moment as uniform circular motion.  Which way is the vector sum of forces on you at this moment?</p></contents>
            <score>1</score>            <answer_text>down</answer_text>            <response>Yes, since down is towards the centre of the circle you are moving in.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>up</answer_text>            <response>No.  This is uniform circular motion (just like the car at the bottom of the valley in the lecture).  At the top of the loop the centre of the circle is below you.  So the vector sum of forces is down.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>forward (i.e. in the direction of your motion)</answer_text>            <response>No, you may have a persistent confusion between velocity and acceleration.  We have seen (draw the motion diagram) that in uniform circular motion the acceleration points toward the centre of the circle.  Newton's 2nd Law tells us that the net force acts in the same direction as the acceleration.  So the vector sum of forces acts down since that is the direction to the centre of the circle.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>zero</answer_text>            <response>No.  Are you thinking that the speed is constant so the acceleration should be zero?  Acceleration is rate of change of velocity, and the direction of the velocity is changing.  So the acceleration is not zero and neither is the vector sum of forces.</response>

        <title>Vertical circle</title>        <contents><p>Think about the part of the video where I was swinging the ball around on the string.  Suppose I swing it in a vertical circle in front of me instead of a horizontal circle above my head.  As the ball passes through the bottom of the circle it is at its maximum speed and so it is neither speeding up nor slowing down.  Thus, we can treat that moment as uniform circular motion.  Which way is the vector sum of forces on it at this instant?</p></contents>
            <score>1</score>            <answer_text>up</answer_text>            <response>Yes, up is the direction to the centre of the circle, so that is the direction of the net force.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>down</answer_text>            <response>No.  At the instant the ball is passing through the bottom of the circle the direction to the centre of the circle is up.  So the vector sum of forces would point up.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>Right, just as it was in the lecture.</answer_text>            <response>No, at the instant the ball is passing through the bottom of the circle the direction to the centre of the circle is up.  So the vector sum of forces would point up.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>In the direction of motion</answer_text>            <response>You may have a persistent misunderstanding leading you to think that the vector sum of forces is always in the direction of motion.  Remember that the Law of Inertia tells us that no force is needed to keep an object in motion.  A motion diagram would show you that the acceleration at this moment is up, and so the vector sum of forces must also be up.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>Since the speed isn't changing the acceleration is zero and so is the vector sum of forces.</answer_text>            <response>Acceleration is not rate of change of speed.  It is rate of change of velocity.   A motion diagram would show you that the acceleration at this moment is up, and so the vector sum of forces must also be up.</response>

So their *periods* are the same and their angular speeds are the same.  But the question asked about speed, not period or angular speed.
