        <title>Why is the rate of change of momentum zero?</title>        <contents><p>You are pushing a box at constant velocity.  You are certainly exerting a force, and we have just defined force as rate of change of momentum.  Yet, the rate of change of momentum is zero.  How can the rate of change of momentum be zero when we are clearly exerting a force on the box?If you answer incorrectly you will be given a hint and asked this question again.</p></contents>
            <score>1</score>            <answer_text>The force you are exerting on the box is not the only force that is acting on the box.</answer_text>            <response>Yes, there is also friction with the floor.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>The force you are exerting on the box is exactly cancelled by the force that the box exerts on you.  All forces come in pairs.</answer_text>            <response>No.  It is true that all forces come in pairs.  But the reasoning you have just given would make all motion impossible since if it was true all forces would always cancel.  Note that the force that the box exerts on you has no effect on the box.  It only affects your motion.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>Our definition of force as a rate of change of momentum is wrong.</answer_text>            <response>No, there is nothing wrong with our definition.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>Pushing on the box doesn't count as a real force since it causes no change in momentum.  It must be a fictitious force like centrifugal force.</answer_text>            <response>No.  Interactions between objects, such as the interaction between you and the box do result in real forces.</response>
            <score>0</score>            <answer_text>The intuitive idea of pushing as a force is incorrect.  Only the rate of change of momentum counts as a force.</answer_text>            <response>No, the intuitive idea is correct (although not precise enough).  If you are pushing on the box you are interacting with it and this results in a force that you are exerting on the box and another one that the box is exerting on you.</response>
