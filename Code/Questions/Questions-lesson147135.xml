            <response>No.  It is a common misconception that normal forces act upward, because they very frequently do act straight upward.  Remember that "normal" means "perpendicular".</response>

            <response>No. This is perpendicular to the surface.  But a normal force is always a "push".  The surface does not pull the object onto itself.  It pushes to keep the object from "falling through the surface".</response>

            <response>No.  The *net* force on the box is zero.  But this just means that all of the forces acting on the box add up to zero.  There is certainly a weight acting down on the box.  If that was the only force acting on the box then it would accelerate down.  So there must be a nonzero normal force acting on the box.</response>

            <response>Is "the strength of the floor" a force?  It is certainly possible to quantify the strength of the floor.  But we haven't discussed this.  Also, if the normal force is "equal to the strength of the floor" wouldn't this mean that the floor would break if the box was any heavier?  This sounds like a dangerous situation indeed!</response>

            <response>No.  The *net* force is zero, but this is very different from the tension being zero.  It means that the sum of all the forces acting on the light is zero.  There is certainly a downward weight force.  For the net force to be zero this must be counteracted by a non-zero tension force.</response>
