        <title>Which has more energy (springs)</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about a spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In situation A the spring is relaxed (i.e. neither stretched, nor compressed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In situation B the same spring is compressed (i.e. its length is less than its equilibrium length).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spring is stationary in both situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this spring have more energy in situation A or in situation B?&lt;/p&gt;

            <response>&lt;p&gt;Yup.  A compressed spring has more  capacity to change itself and other things than a relaxed one does.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <response>&lt;p&gt;If you leave the relaxed spring alone it will just sit there doing nothing.  It has little or no "capacity to cause change" to anything.  What happens to a compressed spring if you let it go?  Does it just sit there doing nothing?&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <response>No.  There are several things wrong with A.
1. It shows the ball starting with lots of kinetic energy and ending up with no kinetic energy, but having gained some gravitational potential energy.  But the ball started at rest (K=0) and went down (so it lost gravitational potential energy).

2. The total energy should be constant.   So the initial should equal the final.

3. The initial total energy bar is wrong because it should be the same height as the initial kinetic energy.  In other words, it doesn't actually show a total.</response>

            <response>Energy is always conserved but individual types of energy are not.  You have stopped so your kinetic energy has definitely "disappeared".  It hasn't really "disappeared", though.  It must have been transformed into another form of energy.</response>

        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Springs of various sorts are often used to "cushion" impacts to prevent damage to various objects.  In a factory a heavy cart full of boxes to be shipped is rolling along a horizontal track.  At the end of the track is a big spring which brings the cart gently to rest.  As the cart runs into the spring and compresses it what is the main energy transformation that is taking place?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>Air puck on spring, released</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Consider an air puck on the end of a spring.  The spring is horizontal as shown.  The air puck starts stationary and the spring is initially compressed.  The air puck is then released and the force by the spring accelerates it.  A short time later the air puck is moving and the spring is relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/air_puck_on_spring_compressed_relaxed.png" width="250" height="233" alt="air puck pushed by a spring" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the system be the air puck and the spring.  Did the system’s K increase or decrease?  Did the system’s U&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; increase or decrease?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>&lt;p&gt;Yes.  U_G starts positive and is zero at the end.  K increases.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <response>&lt;p&gt;No.  The ball must be going  faster at the end than it was at the beginning, so K must increase.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <response>&lt;p&gt;No.  This was the correct bar chart when the axes were at the initial location of the ball so that y_i = 0.  But now the axes are at the bottom of the cliff so y_i is not zero.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <response>&lt;p&gt;No.  There are two problems with this one.  First of  all, the ball ends at the same height as the axes (y = 0).  So  the final U_G must be zero.  Also, the ball was moving at the start, so K_i can't be zero.&lt;/p&gt;</response>
