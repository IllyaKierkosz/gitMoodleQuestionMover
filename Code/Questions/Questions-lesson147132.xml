            <answer_text>The inertia of the box which keeps it sliding.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  Inertia is not a force.  It is "the idea" that things keep moving at constant speed in a straight line unless forces cause them to do otherwise.  The box keeps moving because of inertia.  But that doesn't mean inertia is a force.  It is a statement of what happens in the absence of forces.</response>

            <response>No.  That force exists, but it is a force acting on the floor.  We are talking about forces which act on the box.  You are mixing up the targets of the forces we are talking about.</response>

            <response>No.  Inertia is not a force.  It is "the idea" that things keep moving at constant speed in a straight line unless forces cause them to do otherwise.  You keep moving because of inertia.  But that doesn't mean inertia is a force.  It is a statement of what happens in the absence of forces.</response>

            <response>No.  You and your skates can be thought of as one object and you can't exert a force on yourself, just like I can't pick myself up by my own shoelaces.  Also, there is no forward force on you here.  The reason you keep moving has nothing to do with a force.  It is the principle of inertia: objects keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless forces cause them to do otherwise.</response>

            <response>No.  The box is going up the slope, but it is not accelerating up the slope.
1. Do you expect it to speed up or slow down?  
2. Do the vector addition of the forces acting on the box.</response>

            <response>No.  If the box accelerated straight down then it would "dig into the ramp".  This seems unlikely.  You may be confusing acceleration due to gravity with the acceleration of the object.</response>

            <response>No.  Perhaps you think that because the box is slowing down (presumably...) that it is not accelerating.  Remember that acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.  The velocity of this box is changing (it is slowing down).  So it is accelerating.  So it's acceleration is not zero.</response>

            <response>No.  First of all, this FBD is missing a lot of forces.  Think of what agents the box is in contact with and what contact forces they should exert on it.  Second of all, the box is moving at constant speed in a straight line (in other words, it moves at constant velocity).  So F&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; is zero.</response>

            <response>No.  First of all, the box is in contact with the floor and sliding over it.  So there should be a friction force.  Second of all, it is true that F&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; is zero since the box is moving with a constant velocity.  But the forces drawn on the FBD cannot possibly add up to zero, so the FBD is inconsistent with the net force.</response>

            <response>No.  The box is not in contact with your foot.  So there is no agent which could be responsible for the F_push in this FBD.  Also the normal force should be perpendicular to the ramp, not straight up, and the box is sliding on the ramp so the ramp should be exerting a friction force on it.  Finally, the box is slowing down, so the net force is in the wrong direction.</response>

            <response>No.  Perhaps you think it is up because the largest force acting on the machine is acting up.  But the acceleration is in the direction of the vector sum of the forces.</response>

            <response>No.  The upward tension is bigger than the weight and the other tension also has an upward component.  So the vector sum of the forces must have an upward component.</response>

        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Three crates are being pulled across ice using ropes.  We can ignore gravity and the normal force (because they cancel each other) and friction is small enough that we can ignore it as well.  The crates, the tensions in the ropes are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crate A has mass 10 kg and the tension in the rope pulling it is 6.0 N.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crate B has mass 5 kg and the tension in the rope pulling it is 12 N.&lt;/p&gt;

If there were no other force acting on you then you would accelerate down (falling through the chair, the floor, etc.). So there must be an upward force acting on you.

            <answer_text>the air around you.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  There is a **tiny** upward force exerted on you by the air.  This is buoyancy.  But we can safely ignore buoyancy in a case like this.  If buoyancy kept you from falling you would be able to step out of your window and float.</response>

            <answer_text>the normal force.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  That is the *name* of the force which keeps you from falling through the floor.  The agent is the physical object which causes this force.</response>
