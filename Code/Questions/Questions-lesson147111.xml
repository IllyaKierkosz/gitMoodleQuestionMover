        <title>Units for pressure</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;This question is just about unit analysis, so don't worry that some of the quantities we are using are unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will encounter pressure in other courses, especially if you are in certain of the technology programs where you will take some fluids courses.  Here is one equation which gives a pressure (this is pressure within a stationary fluid)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\Delta P = \rho g h $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where ΔP is a pressure change, ρ is a density (in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), g is an acceleration and h is a height (distance).  From this, determine the correct units of pressure in terms of base SI units.&lt;/p&gt;

            <response>Yes.  142.16 has two digits after the decimal whereas 3.743 has three digits after the decimal.  So in this case the sig. fig. rule for addition says we should round the answer to two digits after the decimal.</response>

            <response>No.  We don't know the 3rd digit after the decimal place in 142.16 kg, so we can't know the 3rd digit after the decimal in the answer.</response>

            <response>No.  It is likely that either you are dropping the final "0" because you've been taught you "always can" or you are mixed up with the sig. fig. rule for multiplication.  But in writing measurements we write all digits that we know, even if they are zero.  The sig. fig. rule for addition tells us that we do know the 2nd digit after the decimal place, so we should write it, even though it is zero.</response>

            <response>There are two problems with this answer.  One is that you've used the standard deviation as the uncertainty in the mean.  But you should use the SDOM (it wasn't given but you can easily calculate it).  The second problem is that you are not correctly applying the significant figures rules.</response>
