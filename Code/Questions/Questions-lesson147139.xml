            <response>Please use common sense.  In a race the person who completes the race in less time must have run faster.  Amy took less time to go around the circle so she must have been running faster.  The *equation*, \( v = 2\pi r/T\) is nothing more than an expression of this common sense notion.</response>

            <response>No.  Both ants complete a "trip around the circle" in the same amount of time (the same amount of time it takes for the turntable to go around once).

            <response>No.  This is uniform circular motion (just like the car at the bottom of the valley in the lecture).  At the top of the loop the centre of the circle is below you.  So the net force is down.</response>

            <response>No, you may have a persistent confusion between velocity and acceleration.  We have seen (draw the motion diagram) that in uniform circular motion the acceleration points toward the centre of the circle.  Newton's 2nd Law tells us that the net force acts in the same direction as the acceleration.  So the net force acts down since that is the direction to the centre of the circle.</response>

            <response>No.  Are you thinking that the speed is constant so the acceleration should be zero?  Acceleration is rate of change of velocity, and the direction of the velocity is changing.  So the acceleration is not zero and neither is the net force.</response>

Remember that Newton's 1st Law tells us that no force is needed to keep an object in motion.  A motion diagram would show you that the acceleration at this moment is up, and so the net force must also be up.</response>

            <response>No.  What is F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;?  What is exerting it.  There is a force acting in the direction indicated for F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, but labelling it this way makes it totally unclear what kind of force it is.  Are you choosing A because you believe that every time something is moving in a circle there must be a force called the "centripetal force" which points to the centre?  This is one of the misconceptions caused by the use of the term "centrifugal force".  Recall that I will not use this term.</response>

            <response>No.  First of all there is no net force accompanying that FBD.  Second of all, what kind of force is the one labelled "v^2/r"?  Labels of forces on free body diagrams should make it clear what kind of forces are there, not attempt to make statements about how they are calculated as those sorts of decisions are best made after you have finished writing down Newton's 2nd Law.</response>

            <response>No.  The net force points towards the centre in uniform circular motion.  Also, the net force points to the centre in uniform circular motion.  Oh, did I mention that the net force points to the centre in uniform circular motion?</response>

            <response>There is no force in the direction of motion.  The net force points towards the centre of the circle.  If there was a force called "F&lt;sub&gt;motion&lt;/sub&gt;", what would the agent of that force be?</response>

        <title>car on banked curve</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;In the lecture we looked at a car going around a curve.Â  The car is going at constant speed.Â  Curves on many highways are banked.Â  Below is a diagram showing a car on a banked curve, seen from above and from behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/car_banked_curve_and_top_view.png" alt="car on banked curve" height="517" width="649" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of the following is the most correct free body diagram for this car.Â  All of these free body diagrams are drawn from the same perspective as the back view of the car in the diagram above.&lt;/p&gt;

            <response>Yes, thinking about agents and about the direction of the net force makes this the only one of the options which could be correct.</response>

            <response>No.  Did you choose this one because you think that if the speed is constant then the acceleration should be zero?  Acceleration is rate of change of velocity, not rate of change of speed.  There is a force on this diagram labelled "F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;".  What would be the agent of this force?</response>

            <response>No.  Did you choose this one because you think that in circular motion there must always be a "centripetal force", labelled "F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;" pointing to the centre?  This is one of the misconceptions caused by the use of the term, centripetal force.  What would be the agent of this force?</response>
