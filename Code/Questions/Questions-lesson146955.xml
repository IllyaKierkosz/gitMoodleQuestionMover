            <response>&lt;p&gt;Yes.  This is not so common in this course since most work you submit will be hand-written.  But I have seen it at times.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <answer_text>&lt;p&gt;Copying assignment solutions from solutions manuals or online sources such as "homework help" sites&lt;/p&gt;</answer_text>
            <response>&lt;p&gt;Yes.  In recent years this has become the most common form of academic misconduct that I catch.  The most common source for students copying assignment solutions is Chegg.  Note that I have an explicit policy stated in the course outline for Chegg and other similar "homework help" sites.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

&lt;p&gt;You reply, "Is the answer posted?"  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not yet," they reply.&lt;/p&gt;

            <answer_text>&lt;p&gt;Keep working on the problem.  It may still be worth it to hand it in.&lt;/p&gt;</answer_text>
            <response>&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Depending on several factors I may decide that the problem will still count for marks, but if the solutions is posted I will carefully police submitted solutions to see whether anyone copied from Chegg.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <answer_text>&lt;p&gt;Stop working on the question, find the question on Chegg and bookmark it so you can check back later to see if the solution is posted.  If a solution is posted, copy it down.&lt;/p&gt;</answer_text>
