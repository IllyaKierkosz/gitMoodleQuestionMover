            <answer_text>The object moves to the left while slowing down.  It stops, then moves to the right while speeding up.  The label "same point" on the duplicates of point 5 indicate that the two parts of the motion are really along the same line, not displaced from each other as shown.</answer_text>
            <response>Yes, it stops at point 5.  </response>

            <response>Yes, but you need to give more detail.  Simply saying the direction of a motion is never sufficient.  A complete description of a motion always includes information about how the velocity is changing.</response>

            <response>No, that's his distance from the origin at the end of his motion.  First of all, pay attention to the sign convention that the definition of the axes defines.  Secondly remember that displacement is

            <answer_text>We can't calculate his displacement.  We need to know what angle the hillside makes with the horizontal.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  Did you watch the video lecture?  There is an example in it which is also on a hillside and angles never came up.  We have defined an x-axis along the slope of the hill, and Olaf moves entirely along this axis.  So we don't have to worry about angles.  We'll deal with things like that once we are working in two dimensions.</response>

            <response>No. First of all, the object is not accelerating in the same direction for the whole time shown. Secondly, we haven't defined "positive" and "negative". As much as possible work with intuitive descriptions of directions (up/down/left/right/north/etc.). You do need to be able to turn these into mathematical descriptions such as positive and negative, but don't do this before you have to.</response>

            <answer_text>The object moves in the positive direction, accelerating in the negative direction.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  First of all, the object is not accelerating for the whole time shown.  Secondly, we haven't defined "positive" and "negative".  As much as possible work with intuitive descriptions of directions (up/down/left/right/north/etc.).  You do need to be able to turn these into mathematical descriptions such as positive and negative, but don't do this before you have to.</response>

            <answer_text>None of them.  Without axes defined we can't figure out the sign of the acceleration vector.</answer_text>
            <response>We eventually found that the direction of the acceleration vector for 1D motion only depends on whether the object is speeding up, slowing down, or moving with constant velocity.  Have another look at the beginning of this lecture and think about what the answer would have been if we had reversed the sign convention.</response>

            <response>Yes, the early part of the motion is with constant velocity, then it is slowing down so the acceleration points opposite to the motion.</response>

            <response>You may have the very common misconception that an object must acceleration to maintain a constant speed.  This may be caused by mixing up the idea of acceleration with the idea of how much "effort" it takes to walk at a constant speed.  Acceleration and effort are entirely different from each other.</response>

            <answer_text>None of them.  Without axes defined we can't figure out the sign of the acceleration vector.</answer_text>
            <response>We eventually found that the direction of the acceleration vector for 1D motion only depends on whether the object is speeding up, slowing down, or moving with constant velocity.  Have another look at the beginning of this lecture and think about what the answer would have been if we had reversed the sign convention.</response>

            <response>No, that's what the x vs. t graph for this motion might look like.  Remember that a vs. t is the slope of v vs. t, not the other way around.</response>

            <response>There are a number of misconceptions about acceleration which might cause you to choose this answer.  You may have a misconception that a forward acceleration is needed for an object to keep moving forward.  Or you may think that smaller velocity implies smaller acceleration.  Remember, the acceleration is the **slope** of the v vs. t graph.</response>
