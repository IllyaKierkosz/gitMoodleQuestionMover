            <response>There are two problems with this answer.  One is that you've used the standard deviation as the uncertainty in the mean.  But you should use the SDOM (it wasn't given but you can easily calculate it).  The second problem is that you are not correctly applying the significant figures rules.</response>

            <response>No,the position of the tip of the vector is (4,1), which might be what you were looking at, except that in that case you reversed the x and y.  But the position of the tip of the vector is not the same thing as the vector.  Remember that if we move a vector this doesn't change its value.  So writing down a vector has nothing to do with where its tip is.</response>

            <response>Yes.  142.16 has two digits after the decimal whereas 3.743 has three digits after the decimal.  So in this case the sig. fig. rule for addition says we should round the answer to two digits after the decimal.</response>

            <response>No.  It is likely that either you are dropping the final "0" because you've been taught you "always can" or you are mixed up with the sig. fig. rule for multiplication.  But in writing measurements we write all digits that we know, even if they are zero.  The sig. fig. rule for addition tells us that we do know the 2nd digit after the decimal place, so we should write it, even though it is zero.</response>

            <response><p>No.  When there is a lot of variation in the result it *may* indicate that the measurement process is not very reliable.  As we will see, this would result in the uncertainty being high.  But we can still obtain a best estimate.</p></response>

        <contents><p>Your friend runs once around a track.  You use a stopwatch to time them.  The stopwatch can be read to the nearest 0.01 s.  So, naively, the uncertainty in the timing is ± 0.005 s.  Do you believe that your measurement of their lap time is this precise?</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> if you get the question wrong you will be given feedback and allowed to try again.  The question will not let you go on to the next part of the video until you answer correctly.</p></contents>

            <answer_text>No.  Other factors such as your reflexes will result in a larger uncertainty.</answer_text>
            <response>Yes.  Typical human reflexes would introduce an uncertainty into this timing of the order of a few tenths of a second.  There are also issues of exactly how you judge when they passed the finish line (i.e. what part of their body crossing the line should trigger you to hit "stop" on the stopwatch?).</response>

            <answer_text>Yes, as long as you were careful doing the timing.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  In fact, we always assume that every measurement is done carefully.  If you do a measurement and realize that you were not careful enough you shouldn't record the result - you should discard it.  So the amount of caution has little to do with the precision.  The precision is determined by the measurement process, and the tools used.</response>

            <answer_text>No.  It is possible that you've made a mistake such as misreading the stopwatch.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  This is why we normally do measurements multiple times.  Measurements that involved mistakes usually "stick out like a sore thumb" compared to the others and we discard them.  The precision of a measurement has nothing to do with whether the person doing the measurement made a mistake.  It is inherent to the measurement process, even if everything was done correctly.</response>

            <response>Yes.  1.234 has 3 digits after the decimal and 0.0179 has 4.  In this case the sig. fig. rule for addition says we round to 3 digits after the decimal.</response>

            <response>Have you mixed the rule up with the rule for multiplication?  You have rounded to the number of sig. figs. of the number with fewer sig. figs.  But the addition rule has to do with digits after the decimal place, not sig. figs.</response>

            <response>There are two problems with this answer.  One is that you've used the standard deviation as the uncertainty in the mean.  But you should use the SDOM (it wasn't given but you can easily calculate it).  The second problem is that you are not correctly applying the significant figures rules.</response>

            <response>You are rounding correctly.  But you have used the standard deviation as the uncertainty when you should be using the SDOM.  The SDOM wasn't given but you can easily calculate it.</response>
