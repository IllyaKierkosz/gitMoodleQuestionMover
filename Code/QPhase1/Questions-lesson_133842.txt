            <response>The spring is compressed.  That is a state change inside the system and involves some change in a type of internal energy which you haven't identified.</response>

        <title>Effect of moving mass and spring</title>
        <contents><p>A mass is hanging by a spring which is suspended from a support.  You carefully lift the support of the spring higher so that the mass and spring are now higher up.  You did this slowly and carefully so that the spring did not lengthen or compress during the process.</p> <p>How has the spring potential energy of the system changed during this process?</p></contents>

            <answer_text>U_S decreased while you were moving the mass and spring to compensate for the kinetic energy that you gave the system.  But then it returned to its initial value when you stopped moving them.</answer_text>
