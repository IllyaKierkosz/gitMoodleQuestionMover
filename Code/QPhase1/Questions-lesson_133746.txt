            <response>No.  You should rewatch the video because you have missed the main point.  Can you push on something when you are not touching it?  If you are a Jedi knight perhaps you can, but otherwise I hope you agree that you cannot.  So how could there be a force (a push...) acting on the book after you are no longer touching the book?</response>

            <answer_text>The book keeps moving because it takes a long time for its inertia to run out.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  Note that I never once mentioned the word "inertia" in the lecture you just watched.  (However, lecture 2 is all about inertia...).  So it would not be reasonable for me to ask you a question about inertia yet.  In any case, as you'll find out in the next lecture, inertia can't "run out".  It is an inherent property of an object.  You should rewatch the video - you have missed the main point.</response>

            <response>No.  I never mentioned the word "force" even once during the lecture you just watched.  So it would be unfair of me to ask a question where the answer had something to do with a force.  In any case, as you'll find out later in the course, there is no such thing as a "force of the motion".  Forces are exerted by physical objects.  They don't just "exist" because of something moving.  You should watch the video again - you have missed the main point.</response>

            <response>No.  The push that you gave the book ends at the moment your hand stopped touching the book.  There is no push by you after the book leaves your hand.  The book does not need a push to keep it going.  You should watch the video again - you have missed the main point.</response>

            <response>No.  This answer is incorrect for a large number of reasons.  As we will see later in the course, *while you were touching the book* the push you were giving it must have been stronger than the friction.  But *after you let go* there is no push due to your hand any more.  No push due to your hand is needed to keep the book moving.  You should watch the video again - you have missed the main point.</response>

            <response>No.  After it leaves your hand (the time we are interested in) there is *no push* due to you.  You cannot push on something if you are not touching it (unless you are a Jedi Knight...).  No push is needed to keep the book moving.  You should watch the video again - you have missed the main point.</response>

            <response>No.  That's what Aristotle (and most people in Europe and the Asia for 1500 years) thought.  But it is inconsistent with experiment.  You should watch the video again - you have missed the main point.</response>

            <response><p>I totally disagree.  Recall that a collision is any interaction between objects which occurs in a limited amount of time.  The scallop and the water both accelerate, so they interact (remember that our current definition of interaction is that it causes acceleration).  They interact for a brief time.  So this may not be what you are used to thinking of as a collision, but it is what we call a collision in physics.</p></response>

I will point out that people are very inconsistent in their use of the term isolated.  However, I've been very clear about what *I* mean by "isolated", and it has nothing to do with energy.</p></response>

            <answer_text>The system is not isolated because the carts stick together.  So the final momentum of the system is smaller than the initial momentum.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  The fact that the carts stick together has nothing to do with whether the system is isolated or not, because the interaction between the carts is an internal interaction.  "Isolated" means that the *external* interactions are negligible.  You have been told that friction is negligible.  Friction is the only external interaction that we would expect to have a significant effect on the system.  Since it is negligible the system is isolated (at least to a good approximation).</response>

            <answer_text>The system is not isolated because the carts are moving in the same direction.  The final momentum of the system is larger than the initial momentum.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  Which way the carts are moving has nothing to do with whether the system is isolated or not.  "Isolated" means that the *external interactions* are negligible.  You have been told that friction is negligible.  Friction is the only external interaction that we would expect to have a significant effect on the system.  Since it is negligible the system is isolated (at least to a good approximation).</response>

            <answer_text>This collision is elastic.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  We haven't learned about elastic/inelastic collisions yet, so it would have been unfair of me to make the correct answer have something to do with the collision being elastic.  As it happens this collision is not elastic - it is *totally inelastic*.  But we will learn about that during the next topic unit of the course.</response>

            <response>It is true that the momentum of the system is conserved.  But it has nothing to do with the fact that the carts stick together.  The momentum is conserved because friction is negligible and so the system is isolated.</response>

            <answer_text>The momentum of the system changes during the collision.</answer_text>
            <response>Yes.  The interaction between the blocks during the collision is presumably very strong and since only one block is in our system this is an external interaction.  So the system is not isolated and the momentum changes.</response>

            <answer_text>Friction with the ice is probably negligible, so the system is isolated.  The system's momentum is conserved.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  It is true that the friction is probably negligible, but note that only one block is in the system.  So the interaction with the other block (which should be a strong interaction) is an external interaction.  The system is not isolated and we should not expect its momentum to be conserved.</response>

            <answer_text>Momentum is conserved because the blocks bounce off of each other.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  Whether the blocks bounce off of each other has nothing to do with whether the momentum is conserved.  As we saw in the video, for cart collisions the momentum was conserved when they "bounced off each other magnetically", but it was *also* conserved when they stuck together.  To decide whether momentum is conserved you have to think about whether the system is isolated (i.e. are there any external interactions).</response>

            <answer_text>The system is isolated because the change of momentum of one block is equal in size to the change of momentum of the other block, but in the opposite direction.  So the system's momentum is conserved.</answer_text>
            <response>It is true that the changes of momentum of the blocks are equal in size and opposite in direction.  But did you notice that the system only includes one block?  So while the sum of the momenta of the blocks doesn't change the system's momentum does change.  This is not an isolated system.</response>
