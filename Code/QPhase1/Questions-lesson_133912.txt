        <title>Person pulling up on spring.  Sign of work?</title>
        <contents><p>A mass is supported on a spring.  A person pulls up on the mass so that the spring becomes less compressed.  Let the system be just the spring.  Consider the force that the mass exerts on the spring.  Does this force do positive work or negative work?</p> <p><img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/person_pulling_up_on_spring.png" width="320" height="446" alt="person pulling up on spring" /></p></contents>

        <title>pushing up ramp, washing machine coming down</title>
        <contents><p>A person is moving a washing machine down a ramp.  To keep it from going too fast they are pushing up the ramp as the washing machine slides down the ramp.  The are pushing hard enough that the washing machine comes down the ramp at constant speed.  The system is the ramp, the Earth and the washing machine.</p> <p>What can say about the work that the person is doing on the system?</p> <p><img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/person_pushing_box_pushing_up_slope_box_coming_down_slope.png" width="283" height="243" alt="person pushing up slope" /></p></contents>

            <response>No.  Did you think this because they are pushing up the slope and you associate up with positive?  Compare the direction of the force with the direction of the force displacement.</response>

            <response>No.  Did you say that because the washing machine is moving at constant speed so the system's kinetic energy is not changing?  But the work done is equal to the change in the total energy of the system, not just the kinetic energy.</response>

            <response>No.  I think you took the system inertia and just multiplied by a speed squared, using the only speed that was provided.  So if you were trying to calculate a kinetic energy you missed a factor of two.  However, finding the kinetic energy of the 50 kg system will not tell you the work done on it.</response>

            <response>No.  The K_cm of the system is 100 J.  The spring is compressed so it must have some U_S and the carts are probably in motion relative to each other so the system would also have some K_conv.  So the system energy must be greater 100 J.</response>

            <response>The amount of compression is determined by the force and by the spring stiffness.  So since we know how their stiffnesses compare and we know that the amounts of compression are the same we can actually draw conclusions about how much force must be used to compress each.</response>
