            <answer_text>Sam and Trogdor agree that the cart's momentum is constant.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  Since Sam's velocity relative to the Earth is changing but the cart's is staying constant relative to the Earth the cart's velocity relative to Sam is changing.  So Sam measures it to be accelerating.  This means that according to Sam the cart's momentum is changing.</response>

            <response>No, you've got it backwards.  The relative velocity between the cart and Trogdor is constant, but the relative velocity between Sam and the cart is changing since Sam is accelerating relative to the Earth.</response>

For example, an object going to the right at 3 m/s then to the left at 2 m/s has the same Delta v as an object going to the right at 8 m/s and then continuing to the right at 3 m/s.</response>

            <answer_text>Yes.  We’ve seen that center of mass velocity is always constant.</answer_text>
            <response>Think about this.  If you kick an object across the floor, friction will eventually bring it to rest.  If the system is just the object then the center of mass is at the center of mass of the one object.  Since the object slows down, the center of mass velocity is clearly not constant.  So apparently the center of mass velocity is not *always* constant.</response>

        <title>Comparing views of coin toss</title>
        <contents><p>You toss a coin up in the air and then catch it.  Your friend standing beside you measures the time between the coin leaving your hand and the catch.</p> <p>A person in a nearby building is in a high speed elevator with glass walls and so they can see the coin toss as well. The elevator is going up fast.  Is the time interval recorded by this person between the coin leaving your hand <em>longer, shorter or the same as</em> the time interval measured by your friend?</p> <p>(In case you think it matters - while the elevator is fast, it is much, much, much, much, much, much, much slower than the speed of light...)</p></contents>

            <answer_text>The time interval is the same.</answer_text>
            <response>Yes.  That's what the Galilean transformation equations tell us.  This is slightly wrong, but for the sorts of speeds involved here you would need clocks much more precise than we have ever built to observe the difference in measured time intervals.  So it is reasonable to use the Galilean transformation.</response>

            <answer_text>Because the elevator is going up the observer in the elevator observes a smaller initial upward speed for the coin.  So according to them the time interval is shorter.</answer_text>
            <response>No, they also see your hand going down.  The lower upward speed is exactly compensated for by the fact that according to them the coin had to fall back down farther to get to your hand. But that is an unnecessarily complicated way of looking at it.  We are talking about the time interval between two events (the coin leaving your hand and the coin arriving back at your hand).  The Galilean transform equations tell us that all observers measure the same time intervals between events.</response>
