        <title>Why is the rate of change of momentum zero?</title>
        <contents><p>You are pushing a box at constant velocity.  You are certainly exerting a force, and we have just defined force as rate of change of momentum.  Yet, the rate of change of momentum is zero.  How can the rate of change of momentum be zero when we are clearly exerting a force on the box?</p> <p><img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/person_pushing_box.png" width="248" height="128" alt="person pushing box" /></p> <p>If you answer incorrectly you will be given a hint and asked this question again.</p></contents>

            <answer_text>The force you are exerting on the box is exactly cancelled by the force that the box exerts on you.  All forces come in pairs.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  It is true that all forces come in pairs.  But the reasoning you have just given would make all motion impossible since if it was true all forces would always cancel.  Note that the force that the box exerts on you has no effect on the box.  It only affects your motion.</response>

            <answer_text>The intuitive idea of pushing as a force is incorrect.  Only the rate of change of momentum counts as a force.</answer_text>
            <response>No, the intuitive idea is correct (although not precise enough).  If you are pushing on the box you are interacting with it and this results in a force that you are exerting on the box and another one that the box is exerting on you.</response>

            <response><p>No.  The elevator is accelerating up and so the woman must also be accelerating up.  Perhaps you are picturing her from the perspective of riding along with her in the elevator.  From that perspective she wouldn't be accelerating.  However, that is an accelerating point of view (i.e. a non-inertial reference frame).  You should not work from such a perspective because the laws of physics as we have been learning them don't apply in such a perspective.</p></response>

            <response><p>No.  Static friction is exerted between surfaces that are not slipping on each other and kinetic friction is exerted between surfaces that are slipping on each other.  Either the box is slipping on the belt or not.  So the conveyor belt can't exert a static friction *and* a kinetic friction on the box.</p> <p>Also, the belt is speeding up, so the box must also  be speeding up if it is not slipping on the belt.  So the acceleration can't be zero.</p></response>

            <response>No.  If this was true then your acceleration would point downwards because the vector sum of forces on you would point downwards.  But you are going up while speeding up so your acceleration must be accelerating upwards.</response>

            <response>No.  This is wrong for several reasons.  First of all, it has a force on it that is apparently exerted by the sled on the ground.  But every force on an FBD of the sled should be a force acting *on* the sled, not forces exerted *by* the sled.  Secondly, what is the agent of the force labelled \( \vec{F}^c_{as}?  Thirdly, the sled is slowing down so its acceleration vector should point opposite to the direction it is going.</response>

            <response>No.  Remember that the impulse is equal to the change in momentum.  What do we know about the changes of momentum of these two balls during the collision?</response>

            <response>No, but you are so close that you can have another shot at this question.  You have forgotten or not noticed that the question is asking about *magnitudes* of the impulses, and magnitudes are positive by definition.</response>

            <response>That has the correct units for a rate of change of momentum.  The rate of change of momentum must be a *change* in momentum divided by a change in time.  What is the change in the box's momentum during the process described?</response>
