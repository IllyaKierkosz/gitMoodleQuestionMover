        <title>direction of net force on person in roller coaster</title>
        <contents><p>You are riding a roller coaster which has a loop. At the instant that you pass through the top of the loop you are at a minimum speed, so you are neither speeding up nor slowing down.  So we can treat this moment as uniform circular motion.  Which way is the vector sum of forces on you at this moment?</p></contents>

            <response>No.  This is uniform circular motion (just like the car at the bottom of the valley in the lecture).  At the top of the loop the centre of the circle is below you.  So the vector sum of forces is down.</response>

            <answer_text>forward (i.e. in the direction of your motion)</answer_text>
            <response>No, you may have a persistent confusion between velocity and acceleration.  We have seen (draw the motion diagram) that in uniform circular motion the acceleration points toward the centre of the circle.  Newton's 2nd Law tells us that the net force acts in the same direction as the acceleration.  So the vector sum of forces acts down since that is the direction to the centre of the circle.</response>

            <response>No.  Are you thinking that the speed is constant so the acceleration should be zero?  Acceleration is rate of change of velocity, and the direction of the velocity is changing.  So the acceleration is not zero and neither is the vector sum of forces.</response>

            <response>You may have a persistent misunderstanding leading you to think that the vector sum of forces is always in the direction of motion.  Remember that the Law of Inertia tells us that no force is needed to keep an object in motion.  A motion diagram would show you that the acceleration at this moment is up, and so the vector sum of forces must also be up.</response>

            <response>Did you think that the angular acceleration is negative because the disk is slowing down?  Just like with acceleration components earlier in the course, the sign of the angular acceleration does not tell you whether the object is speeding up or slowing down.  Think of what the angular velocity vs. time graph must look like and decide whether it has a positive or negative slope.</response>

            <response>No.  Counterclockwise is positive and the disk is rotating clockwise.  Also, did you think that angular acceleration is negative because the disk is slowing down?  That's not what the sign of angular acceleration tells you.</response>

            <response>Please use common sense.  In a race the person who completes the race in less time must have run faster.  Amy took less time to go around the circle so she must have been running faster.  They have gone the same distance.  Amy did it in less time.
