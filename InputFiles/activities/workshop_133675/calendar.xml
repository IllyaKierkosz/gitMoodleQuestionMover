    <name>Motion diagram and graph activity - too ambitious opens for submissions</name>
    <description>&lt;div class="no-overflow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is to get you used to doing workshops during class.  Normally in a workshop you will be given a problem to work on in a group.  This one isn't exactly a problem.  It is more of a quick conceptual activity because I am not sure that we (your or I) are comfortable enough with this to try doing  it with a more involved problem.  In your groups you will discuss the activity and complete it.  Every one of you will make your own submissions.  Then you will be given some submissions by other people to mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
