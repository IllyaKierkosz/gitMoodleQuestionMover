        <title>Reflect before you start</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;This lesson is called Momentum.  It will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the "natural state" of motion for any object?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inertia, momentum, and impulse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Law of Conservation of Momentum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start to look at any complicated content, whether it is a textbook, a set of video lectures, a web page, whatever, it is a good idea to prepare to learn by doing a bit of reflection.  To develop the habit it is good to write some reflections.  In the space below write three things (sentences, point form, whatever you want) about what you are about to learn.  Here are some things you might write about below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you think you might learn about in the lesson (in more detail than was given in the list above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you already know about the topics of this lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you have heard about these topics, but don't understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</contents>

        <title>Main page - choose lesson part</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You do not have to finish the lesson all in one sitting.  You may reattempt it if you are not satisfied with how you did.  Here is a "map" of the lesson.  This is partly because moodle has a tendency (which I haven't figured out) to skip the Reflective Writing parts of these lessons.  This map will help you see if you have missed any and find your way to where they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/lesson_map_momentum.png" width="1306" height="1050" alt="Lesson Map" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose one of the following lesson parts.  When you have finished that part of the lesson you will be brought back to this page.  When you have finished all parts of the lesson click the "OK, I'm done" button to end the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>No.  You should rewatch the video because you have missed the main point.  Can you push on something when you are not touching it?  If you are a Jedi knight perhaps you can, but otherwise I hope you agree that you cannot.  So how could there be a force (a push...) acting on the book after you are no longer touching the book?</response>

            <answer_text>The book keeps moving because it takes a long time for its inertia to run out.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  Note that I never once mentioned the word "inertia" in the lecture you just watched.  (However, lecture 2 is all about inertia...).  So it would not be reasonable for me to ask you a question about inertia yet.  In any case, as you'll find out in the next lecture, inertia can't "run out".  It is an inherent property of an object.  You should rewatch the video - you have missed the main point.</response>

            <answer_text>The book keeps moving because the force of its motion is stronger than the friction.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  I never mentioned the word "force" even once during the lecture you just watched.  So it would be unfair of me to ask a question where the answer had something to do with a force.  In any case, as you'll find out later in the course, there is no such thing as a "force of the motion".  Forces are exerted by physical objects.  They don't just "exist" because of something moving.  You should watch the video again - you have missed the main point.</response>

            <response>No.  The push that you gave the book ends at the moment your hand stopped touching the book.  There is no push by you after the book leaves your hand.  The book does not need a push to keep it going.  You should watch the video again - you have missed the main point.</response>

            <answer_text>The book stops because friction is stronger than the push that you gave the book.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  This answer is incorrect for a large number of reasons.  As we will see later in the course, *while you were touching the book* the push you were giving it must have been stronger than the friction.  But *after you let go* there is no push due to your hand any more.  No push due to your hand is needed to keep the book moving.  You should watch the video again - you have missed the main point.</response>

            <answer_text>The book stops because the push you gave it gets weaker and weaker.  Eventually it is weaker than friction and the book stops.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  After it leaves your hand (the time we are interested in) there is *no push* due to you.  You cannot push on something if you are not touching it (unless you are a Jedi Knight...).  No push is needed to keep the book moving.  You should watch the video again - you have missed the main point.</response>

            <answer_text>The book stops because all moving objects eventually stop.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  That's what Aristotle (and most people in Europe and the Asia for 1500 years) thought.  But it is inconsistent with experiment.  You should watch the video again - you have missed the main point.</response>

        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Scallops swim by sucking water in at the front and then quickly shooting the water out of the back of their shell.  The diagram below shows three times during the motion of a scallop.  The system is defined in the diagram.  Which of the following is the best description of my choice of system.&lt;/p&gt;

            <response>No.  Their inertias are different (one is 2000 kg and the other is 20 000 kg).  We find their (magnitudes of) momenta just by multiplying their inertias by their speeds.  This gives 2 X 10^4 kg m/s for both objects.</response>

        <title>Is the scallop isolated?</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;A swimming scallop sucks in some water.  It then quickly closes its shell and squirts the water out of the back of the scallop.  This causes the scallop to speed up.  If the system is defined as just the scallop, is the system isolated?&lt;/p&gt;

            <answer_text>&lt;p&gt;No, because its momentum changes.&lt;/p&gt;</answer_text>
            <response>&lt;p&gt;Yes.  A system's momentum changes because of external interactions, and if the system (the scallop) is interacting with objects outside the system, then by definition it is not isolated.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <answer_text>&lt;p&gt;Yes, because it doesn’t collide with anything.&lt;/p&gt;</answer_text>
            <response>&lt;p&gt;I totally disagree.  Recall that a collision is any interaction between objects which occurs in a limited amount of time.  The scallop and the water both accelerate, so they interact (remember that our current definition of interaction is that it causes acceleration).  They interact for a brief time.  So this may not be what you are used to thinking of as a collision, but it is what we call a collision in physics.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <response>&lt;p&gt;No.  My system is the scallop, full stop.  The water is not in the system.  In this course we are never allowing objects to enter or leave our systems.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <answer_text>&lt;p&gt;No, because the system’s kinetic energy changes.&lt;/p&gt;</answer_text>
            <response>&lt;p&gt;Well, you should be suspicious when I offer you a question answer that uses an idea we haven't seen yet in the course.  We haven't studied energy yet.  For us, the word "isolated" has nothing to do with energy.  As I'll discuss in the unit on energy (coming up...) I will point out that people are very inconsistent in their use of the term isolated.  However, I've been very clear about what *I* mean by "isolated", and it has nothing to do with energy.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

        <title>Is the car collision isolated?</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;According to the data presented in the graph below, is the system consisting of the two cars isolated (at least approximately)?&lt;/p&gt;

            <answer_text>&lt;p&gt;Yes.  The total momentum is approximately constant.&lt;/p&gt;</answer_text>

            <answer_text>&lt;p&gt;No.  The momentums of both cars changed.&lt;/p&gt;</answer_text>
            <response>&lt;p&gt;But we are not interested in the momentum of each car individually.  If that was what determined whether the system was isolated then *no* system would be isolated (unless the objects in it were not interacting with each other, which is a pretty boring situation).  That wouldn't be a useful definition.  A system is isolated if it does not interact with external objects.  We have seen that whenever this is true there is something else that must also be true...&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <answer_text>&lt;p&gt;No.  The cars seem to be sticking together, not bouncing apart.&lt;/p&gt;</answer_text>
            <response>&lt;p&gt;This has nothing to do with whether the system is isolated or not.  We have seen for cart collisions that collisions between the "velcro ends" of the carts can still be isolated.  Review what the definition of isolated is.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

            <answer_text>&lt;p&gt;We can’t tell from the data.  We need to know whether there are external interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</answer_text>
            <response>&lt;p&gt;We most certainly can tell from the data.  In general in the sciences, data is the only way we really know anything.  It is true that we want to know whether there are external interactions, because that is how we define "isolated".  But we have seen that something (about the data...) is always true if a system is isolated.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

        <title>All reflections</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;This is only here so that if the Lesson navigation failed and you couldn't access one of the Reflective Writing pages you can view their content here.  Most of the time there should be no need for you to visit this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------First Half-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take out a piece of paper.  Write "PHYS 1104 - Response to Unit 4 Video Lectures" across the top of the paper.  &lt;strong&gt;Don't put your name on it&lt;/strong&gt;; I would rather mark "blind".  Write a big heading saying "First Half".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question beyond the lecture: Ask a question that goes beyond what was covered in the lectures.  This could be a question about a topic that you think might be related to the lectures, or something that you suspect might be a more advanced topic that the material in these lectures might eventually lead to.  Or it might be something that I mentioned briefly, but didn't go into detail on.  Make your question as specific as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In your own words, explain what properties of an object determine its inertia.  To be clear, I'm &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; asking how we &lt;strong&gt;measure&lt;/strong&gt; inertia.  I am asking what properties of an object you might change in order to change the object's inertia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will add more to this sheet after one of the other lectures in this unit.  You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;------------End of Lesson-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after the first half of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for the first half of the lesson write a heading saying "End of Lectures".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In your own words, explain what it means for a quantity to be extensive.  Give an example of a property of a bag of cookies that is an extensive property.  Give an example of a property of a bag of cookies that is not extensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>Reflect on what you have learned (final summary)</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after the first half of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for the first half of the lesson write a heading saying "End of Lectures".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In your own words, explain what it means for a quantity to be extensive.  Give an example of a property of a bag of cookies that is an extensive property.  Give an example of a property of a bag of cookies that is not extensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>Reflect on what you have learned</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;Take out a piece of paper.  Write "PHYS 1104 - Response to Unit 4 Video Lectures" across the top of the paper.  &lt;strong&gt;Don't put your name on it&lt;/strong&gt;; I would rather mark "blind".  Write a big heading saying "First Half".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question beyond the lecture: Ask a question that goes beyond what was covered in the lectures.  This could be a question about a topic that you think might be related to the lectures, or something that you suspect might be a more advanced topic that the material in these lectures might eventually lead to.  Or it might be something that I mentioned briefly, but didn't go into detail on.  Make your question as specific as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In your own words, explain what properties of an object determine its inertia.  To be clear, I'm &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; asking how we &lt;strong&gt;measure&lt;/strong&gt; inertia.  I am asking what properties of an object you might change in order to change the object's inertia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will add more to this sheet after one of the other lectures in this unit.  You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <answer_text>&lt;p&gt;The “cat density” (cats/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the houses&lt;/p&gt;</answer_text>
            <response>&lt;p&gt;No.  The cat density for the system would be the total number of cats divided by the total floor area.  Both the number of cats and the floor area are extensive (proportional to system size), but that means that when we divide one by the other we get a cancellation of the proportionality.  So the cat density is not proportional to system size.&lt;/p&gt;</response>

        <title>Which are extensive?</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;A box of gas has some temperature, pressure, volume, inertia (which you might prefer calling mass), number of atoms, and average speed of atoms.  Which of these quantities are extensive?  Hint: think of how the quantities would (or would not) change if you combined the box with an identical box so that you had twice as much gas.  For clarity, the quantities you are thinking about are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;temperature&lt;br /&gt;pressure&lt;br /&gt;volume&lt;br /&gt;inertia&lt;br /&gt;number of atoms&lt;br /&gt;average speed of atoms&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>No.  All of these quantities would remain *unchanged* by adding another identical box of gas.  For example, think of what cooking would be like if adding more water to a pot increased the temperature...  But if we add another identical box of gas all of the extensive quantities would double.  So these are not extensive (in fact, they are another special case of quantity which doesn't depend on system size at all - these are called "intensive" quantities)</response>

If pressure was extensive then if you measured the pressure in your house, then opened the door (adding the entire atmosphere to "the system" the pressure in your house would suddenly increase by an enormous amount.  We can be thankful this isn't the case.

If you add another identical box of gas to the system then all of the extensive quantities should double.  Which other quantity behaves this way?

        <title>Which are extensive? - 2</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;A city could be described by many different quantities.  For example you might choose to describe cities by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;population density (people per square km)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;average age of residents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number of houses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of these quantities are extensive?  Hint: think of how each of these quantities would change (or would not change...) if you added another identical city to "your system".&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>No, if you add another identical city to the system then all of the extensive quantities should double.  Both population and area would double (so they are extensive...) but population density is population/area, so the factors of two in numerator and denominator would cancel.  So population density is unchanged by adding another city to our system.  Thus it is not extensive.</response>

            <response>No.  The fact that the carts stick together has nothing to do with whether the system is isolated or not, because the interaction between the carts is an internal interaction.  "Isolated" means that the *external* interactions are negligible.  You have been told that friction is negligible.  Friction is the only external interaction that we would expect to have a significant effect on the system.  Since it is negligible the system is isolated (at least to a good approximation).</response>

            <answer_text>The momentum of the system changes during the collision.</answer_text>
            <response>Yes.  The interaction between the blocks during the collision is presumably very strong and since only one block is in our system this is an external interaction.  So the system is not isolated and the momentum changes.</response>

            <answer_text>Friction with the ice is probably negligible, so the system is isolated.  The system's momentum is conserved.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  It is true that the friction is probably negligible, but note that only one block is in the system.  So the interaction with the other block (which should be a strong interaction) is an external interaction.  The system is not isolated and we should not expect its momentum to be conserved.</response>

            <answer_text>The collision is totally inelastic, so momentum is not conserved.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  We haven't learned about elastic/inelastic collisions yet, so it would have been unfair of me to make the correct answer have something to do with the collision being elastic or not.  As it happens this collision is definitely not totally inelastic.  Also, momentum conservation has nothing to do with whether the collision is elastic or not.  We will learn about this during the next topic unit in the course.</response>

            <answer_text>Momentum is conserved because the blocks bounce off of each other.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  Whether the blocks bounce off of each other has nothing to do with whether the momentum is conserved.  As we saw in the video, for cart collisions the momentum was conserved when they "bounced off each other magnetically", but it was *also* conserved when they stuck together.  To decide whether momentum is conserved you have to think about whether the system is isolated (i.e. are there any external interactions).</response>

            <answer_text>The system is isolated because the change of momentum of one block is equal in size to the change of momentum of the other block, but in the opposite direction.  So the system's momentum is conserved.</answer_text>
            <response>It is true that the changes of momentum of the blocks are equal in size and opposite in direction.  But did you notice that the system only includes one block?  So while the sum of the momenta of the blocks doesn't change the system's momentum does change.  This is not an isolated system.</response>
