        <title>Reflect before you start</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;This lesson is called The Principle of Relativity, because it concerns how different observers moving &lt;strong&gt;relative&lt;/strong&gt; to each other may measure different properties of physical systems, but experiments they do will, nevertheless, agree on what physical laws are being obeyed.  It will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inertial and non-inertial reference frames&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What quantities do different observers measure to be different when they both observe the same physical process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Principle of Relativity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the Principle of Relativity to solve collision problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start to look at any complicated content, whether it is a textbook, a set of video lectures, a web page, whatever, it is a good idea to prepare to learn by doing a bit of reflection.  To develop the habit it is good to write some reflections.  In the space below write three things (sentences, point form, whatever you want) about what you are about to learn.  Here are some things you might write about below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you think you might learn about in the lesson (in more detail than was given in the list above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you already know about the topics of this lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List things that you have heard about these topics, but don't understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</contents>

        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You do not have to finish the lesson all in one sitting.  You may reattempt it if you are not satisfied with how you did.  Here is a "map" of the lesson.  This is partly because moodle has a tendency (which I haven't figured out) to skip the Reflective Writing parts of these lessons.  This map will help you see if you have missed any and find your way to where they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/lesson_map_princ_relativity.png" width="1202" height="702" alt="lesson map" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose one of the following lesson parts.  When you have finished that part of the lesson you will be brought back to this page.  When you have finished all parts of the lesson click the "OK, I'm done" button to end the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <answer_text>Sam and Trogdor agree that the cart's momentum is constant.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  Since Sam's velocity relative to the Earth is changing but the cart's is staying constant relative to the Earth the cart's velocity relative to Sam is changing.  So Sam measures it to be accelerating.  This means that according to Sam the cart's momentum is changing.</response>

            <response>No, you've got it backwards.  The relative velocity between the cart and Trogdor is constant, but the relative velocity between Sam and the cart is changing since Sam is accelerating relative to the Earth.</response>

&lt;p&gt;Olaf has finally caught up with the Human Torch to give him a big hug.  Their cart's A and B are moving at the velocities shown in the diagram before they collide.  The cart's collide and bounce off of each other elastically.  You and Sam are watching this process and making careful measurements.  You are stationary on the ground and Sam is riding by on his bicycle at constant velocity.  The system is the two carts, Olaf and the Human Torch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of the following is true?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <response>No.  Does that make sense?  The change in the momentum of the system would just be the sum of the changes of momentum of the carts.  So if you agree on the changes of momentum of each cart how could you disagree on the change of momentum of the whole system?</response>

            <answer_text>Because they all measure the same \( \Delta \vec{v} \) vectors for the objects, every observer agrees about whether the objects have changed direction.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  Remember that the sign of a Delta v component does not tell you whether an object has changed direction.  For example, an object going to the right at 3 m/s then to the left at 2 m/s has the same Delta v as an object going to the right at 8 m/s and then continuing to the right at 3 m/s.</response>

Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question beyond the lecture: Ask a question that goes beyond what was covered in the lectures.  This could be a question about a topic that you think might be related to the lectures, or something that you suspect might be a more advanced topic that the material in these lectures might eventually lead to.  Or it might be something that I mentioned briefly, but didn't go into detail on.  Make your question as specific as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. (a) If an object's acceleration is zero in one inertial reference frame then is its acceleration zero in all other inertial reference frames? (b) If an object's velocity is zero in one inertial reference frame then is its velocity zero in all other inertial reference frames?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will add more to this sheet after one of the other lectures in this unit.  You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>Is center of mass velocity constant?</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;A collisions occurs between two cars.  Both cars had their brakes applied before during and after the collision.  The system is just the two cars.  Was the center of mass velocity of the system constant during this collision?  Hint: remember that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\vec{v}_{AZ} = \frac{\vec{p}_{ASys}}{m_{Sys}}$$&lt;/p&gt;

            <answer_text>Yes.  We’ve seen that center of mass velocity is always constant.</answer_text>
            <response>Think about this.  If you kick an object across the floor, friction will eventually bring it to rest.  If the system is just the object then the center of mass is at the center of mass of the one object.  Since the object slows down, the center of mass velocity is clearly not constant.  So apparently the center of mass velocity is not *always* constant.</response>

        <title>Reflect on what you have learned (final summary)</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after the first half of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for the first half of the lesson write a heading saying "End of Lectures".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. We have seen that a system's kinetic energy can be divided into the center of mass kinetic energy, \(K_{CM} \) and the convertible kinetic energy, \(K_{conv} \).  Suppose two observers, both in inertial frames but moving at different velocities, observe the same system. Which part of a system's kinetic energy (\( K_{CM} \) or \( K_{conv} \)) will they agree on and which part will they disagree on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

&lt;p&gt;----------First Half-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take out a piece of paper.  Write "PHYS 1104 - Response to Unit 6 Video Lectures" across the top of the paper.  &lt;strong&gt;Don't put your name on it&lt;/strong&gt;; I would rather mark "blind".  Write a big heading saying "First Half".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that heading answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question beyond the lecture: Ask a question that goes beyond what was covered in the lectures.  This could be a question about a topic that you think might be related to the lectures, or something that you suspect might be a more advanced topic that the material in these lectures might eventually lead to.  Or it might be something that I mentioned briefly, but didn't go into detail on.  Make your question as specific as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. (a) If an object's acceleration is zero in one inertial reference frame then is its acceleration zero in all other inertial reference frames? (b) If an object's velocity is zero in one inertial reference frame then is its velocity zero in all other inertial reference frames?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will add more to this sheet after one of the other lectures in this unit.  You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;------------End of Lesson-----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should already have a sheet of paper that you wrote some things on after the first half of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what you wrote for the first half of the lesson write a heading saying "End of Lectures".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Point of confusion: Identify something that confused you during the lecture.  If you are still confused by it then try to explain, in reasonable detail, exactly why you are confused.  If you are no longer confused then explain how you resolved your confusion (i.e. what realizations led you to no longer being confused).  Be as specific as you can about the nature of your confusion.  It is not acceptable to simply say that you were not confused by anything.  If you think you were not confused by anything then you are not thinking about the material carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Something you have seen before: Identify something from any of the videos on this unit that you have seen before.  If it was presented differently from how you have seen it previously then briefly describe the difference.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing in the videos was something you have seen before.  All knowledge is built on earlier knowledge and there must be something in these videos that was at least somewhat familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. We have seen that a system's kinetic energy can be divided into the center of mass kinetic energy, \(K_{CM} \) and the convertible kinetic energy, \(K_{conv} \).  Suppose two observers, both in inertial frames but moving at different velocities, observe the same system. Which part of a system's kinetic energy (\( K_{CM} \) or \( K_{conv} \)) will they agree on and which part will they disagree on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will take a picture of your written response to the lesson with your phone and submit it to moodle after you have finished the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>Comparing views of coin toss</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;You toss a coin up in the air and then catch it.  Your friend standing beside you measures the time between the coin leaving your hand and the catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person in a nearby building is in a high speed elevator with glass walls and so they can see the coin toss as well. The elevator is going up fast.  Is the time interval recorded by this person between the coin leaving your hand &lt;em&gt;longer, shorter or the same as&lt;/em&gt; the time interval measured by your friend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In case you think it matters - while the elevator is fast, it is much, much, much, much, much, much, much slower than the speed of light...)&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <answer_text>The time interval is the same.</answer_text>
            <response>Yes.  That's what the Galilean transformation equations tell us.

This is slightly wrong, but for the sorts of speeds involved here you would need clocks much more precise than we have ever built to observe the difference in measured time intervals.  So it is reasonable to use the Galilean transformation.</response>

            <answer_text>Because the elevator is going up the observer in the elevator observes a smaller initial upward speed for the coin.  So according to them the time interval is shorter.</answer_text>
            <response>No, they also see your hand going down.  The lower upward speed is exactly compensated for by the fact that according to them the coin had to fall back down farther to get to your hand.
But that is an unnecessarily complicated way of looking at it.  We are talking about the time interval between two events (the coin leaving your hand and the coin arriving back at your hand).  The Galilean transform equations tell us that all observers measure the same time intervals between events.</response>

        <title>You and Sam observing collision - energy</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/olaf_human_torch_you_sam_rrsl.png" width="1012" height="329" alt="carts and observers" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olaf has finally caught up with the Human Torch to give him a big hug.  Their cart's A and B are moving at the velocities shown in the diagram before they collide.  The cart's collide and bounce off of each other elastically.  You and Sam are watching this process and making careful measurements.  You are stationary on the ground and Sam is riding by on his bicycle at constant velocity.  The system is the two carts, Olaf and the Human Torch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of the following is true?&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

            <answer_text>You and Sam agree that the change of kinetic energy during the collision was zero.  But you disagree about how much the kinetic energy of each cart has changed.</answer_text>

            <response>No.  Both carts are going faster according to Sam, but kinetic energy is a nonlinear function of speed.  You will agree about the delta-v of each cart, but because of the non-linear nature of kinetic energy Sam will see a larger change of kinetic energy.</response>

            <answer_text>According to you the system's kinetic energy did not change.  But according to Sam it did change.  So you disagree about whether the collision was elastic.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  If you disagreed about the change in kinetic energy of the system then you would also have to disagree about a state change either in the system or in the environment.  Does it make sense (for example) that according to one of you the bumper on one of the carts got bent but the other of you could not observe this?</response>

            <answer_text>You agree about the changes in kinetic energy of each cart but you disagree about the change of kinetic energy of the system.</answer_text>
            <response>No.  Does that make sense?  The change of the system's kinetic energy would just be sum of the changes of the kinetic energy of each cart.  So if you agreed on the change of K of each cart then you would have to agree on the change of K for the system.</response>
