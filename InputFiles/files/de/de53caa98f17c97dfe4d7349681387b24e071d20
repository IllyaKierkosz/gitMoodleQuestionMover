:QUESTION:H
Two speakers a few meters apart are playing a single steady note and are in phase.  As you walk around the speakers you note that there are places where you hear nothing (nodes) and others where the sound is loud (antinodes).  You mark a position of an on an antinode and measure the distance to each speaker from that point.  You find that the distances to the speakers differ by 30 cm.  What is the longest wavelength of sound that the speakers could be producing?

:QUESTION:H
Two speakers separated by several meters are in phase with each other and are playing a constant note.  As you walk along the line between them you notice that there are places where you hear nothing (nodes) and others where the note is loud (antinodes).  Do you expect to find a node or an antinode exactly halfway between the speakers?
