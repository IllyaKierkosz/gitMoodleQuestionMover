The diagram below shows a uniform B field pointing out of the screen.  Two square current loops, each carrying an identical current, I, are shown.  Loop A is oriented in the plane of the screen.  Loop B is "side on" so that it is perpendicular to the screen and we see it from the side (so it looks like a line).   Both loops measures L on each side.  Which statement best describes the magnetic fluxes through the two loops?

The diagram shows a loop of wire.  The loop is not attached to a battery or other current source.  The loop is in the plane of the screen.  A uniform B field points out of the screen.  At some instant the magnitude of the B field suddenly increases.  It then remains constant at a new, higher, value.  Which statement best describes the current in the wire.

:ANSWER1:100:H
No current initially flows in the wire.  When the B field increases a current will flow clockwise in the wire while it is increasing.  No current flows once the B field reaches its new higher magnitude.
:ANSWER2:0:H
No current initially flows in the wire.  When the B field increases a current will flow counterclockwise in the wire while it is increasing.  No current flows once the B field reaches its new higher magnitude.
:ANSWER3:0:H
No current will flow in the wire at any time throughout this process.
:ANSWER4:0:H
A current flows clockwise in the loop while the B field is at its initial value.  The current increases when the B field increases in magnitude.
:ANSWER5:0:H
A current flows counterclockwise in the loop while the B field is at its initial value.  The current increases when the B field increases in magnitude.

A solenoidal coil has no current flowing it but is connected to an ammeter.  A permanent magnet is slowly inserted into the coil, left stationary in the solenoid for a while and then quickly pulled out.  A current in the solenoid is detected by the ammeter at various times during this process.  Which of the following best describes this current?

:ANSWER1:100:H
A small current flows while the magnet is being slowly inserted.  There is no current while the magnet is stationary in the solenoid.  A larger current flows when the magnet is quickly withdrawn.
:ANSWER2:0:H
A large current flows while the magnet is being slowly inserted.  There is no current while the magnet is stationary in the solenoid.  A smaller current flows when the magnet is quickly withdrawn.
:ANSWER3:0:H
The current builds slowly as the magnet is inserted.  The current remains high while the magnet is left in the solenoid.  The current then quickly drops to zero as the magnet is withdrawn.
:ANSWER4:0:H
There is no current in the solenoid.

A loop of wire is held over the north pole of a permanent magnet.  The loop is not connected to a battery or other current source but it is connected to an ammeter.

:ANSWER1:100:H
A small current flows in the loop when it is moved slowly towards the magnet.  The current stops while the loop is held close to the magnet.  A larger current flows when the loop is moved quickly away from the magnet.
:ANSWER2:0:H
A large current flows in the loop when it is moved slowly towards the magnet.  The current stops while the loop is held close to the magnet.  A smaller current flows when the loop is moved quickly away from the magnet.
:ANSWER3:0:H
The current increases as the loop is brought closer to the magnet.  It remains at a high value while the loop is held close to the magnet.  It then rapidly decreases when the loop is pulled quickly away from the magnet.

There is no current in the loop.
