Light of wavelength, &#955;, arriving at a fringe in a double slit interference
pattern is a mix of light from the two slits. The light from one slit has
travelled slightly farther than the light from the other slit. The difference in
the path lengths from the two slits to the m = 2 fringe is\:

Light from a small, bright, single-wavelength lamp is passed through a

Both screens will show sharp edged, round spots of light.
:ANSWER3:0:H
Both screens will show alternating rings of light and dark.
:ANSWER4:0:H
Screen A will show alternating rings of light and dark but screen B
will show a sharp-edged, round spot of light.
:ANSWER5:0:H
Screen A will show a sharp-edged, round spot of light, but the light will be unable to pass through such a small pinhole so screen B will show nothing.

:QUESTION:H
Light passing through a single slit refracts (the wave fronts spread out behind the slit).  It produces an interference pattern because
:IMAGE:

:ANSWERORDER:randomized
:INDICES:letters
:ANSWER1:100:H
light leaving from anywhere in the slit can interfere with light half of the slit spacing away (a/2).
:ANSWER2:0:H
light leaving from one side of the slit interferes with light leaving from the other side of the slit.
:ANSWER3:0:H
the two sides of the slit act like two sources, just like a double slit would.
:ANSWER4:0:H
the light simply does not diffract through some angles so there are dark bands.
