:TITLE:cutting a magnet in half
:FEEDBACK:H

:QUESTION:H
You have a bar magnet.  It has a north end and a south end.  The north end is attracted to the south pole of another magnet.  The south end is repelled by the south pole of another magnet.  What happens if you cut your bar magnet in half?

:ANSWERORDER:randomized
:INDICES:letters
:ANSWER1:100:H
Each end is a complete new magnet with a north pole and a south pole.  The north end of each will be attracted to the south pole of another magnet.  The south end of each will be repelled by the south pole of another magnet.
:ANSWER2:0:H
Each end is a new magnet.  The entire end that was the north end will be attracted to the south pole of another magnet.  The entire end that was the south end will be repelled by the south pole of another magnet.
:ANSWER3:0:H
The magnetic properties of the bar magnet are destroyed by cutting it in half.
