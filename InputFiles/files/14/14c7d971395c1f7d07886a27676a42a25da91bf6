:ANSWERORDER:randomized
:INDICES:letters
:ANSWER1:100:H
They pass through each other with the displacement of the medium being the sum of the displacements due to the individual waves.
:ANSWER2:0:H
They bounce off of each other.
:ANSWER3:0:H
They bounce off of each other and during the collision the displacement of the medium is the sum of the displacements due to the individual waves.
:ANSWER4:0:H
They pass through each other and the displacement of the medium is the displacement due to the larger wave.

:TITLE:interference from two speakers (in line)
:FEEDBACK:H

:QUESTION:H
Two speakers, which are good approximations of point sources, are on the x-axis.  They are playing the same steady tone, in phase with each other.  The speakers are separated by exactly half of a wavelength.  If you walk away from them along the x-axis what will you hear?
:IMAGE:
:LAYOUT:vertical
:ANSWERORDER:randomized
:INDICES:letters
:ANSWER1:100:H
you won't hear the speakers at all because of destructive interference.
:ANSWER2:0:H
the sound from the speakers modulate between high pitch and low pitch as you move along the x-axis.
:ANSWER3:0:H
there will be as steady sound that is twice as loud as the sound from one speaker.
:ANSWER4:0:H
the sound from the speakers alternate between loud and silent as you move along the x-axis.

standing waves of amplitude 40 cm with nodes separated by 0.5 m.
:ANSWER2:0:H
standing waves of amplitude 40 cm with nodes separated by 1.0 m.
:ANSWER3:0:H
standing waves of amplitude 20 cm with nodes separated by 0.5 m.
:ANSWER4:0:H
a big confused mess as the waves interfere constructively in some places and destructively in other places.
