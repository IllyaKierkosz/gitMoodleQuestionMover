:QUESTION:H
A large tank of water has a crack in the wall near the bottom.  Water sprays out of this hole at high speed because
:IMAGE:
:LAYOUT:vertical
:ANSWERORDER:randomized
:INDICES:letters
:ANSWER1:100:H
The pressure inside the tank is much greater than the pressure outside so the water is accelerated out the hole.
:ANSWER2:0:H
Gravity pulls very strongly on the water lower in the tank so it falls out of the crack faster.
:ANSWER3:0:H
The water deep in the tank is highly compressed by the pressure so it expands out the hole with great speed.
:ANSWER4:0:H
The water deep in the tank is moving very fast because of the high pressure, so it emerges from the crack with high speed.
